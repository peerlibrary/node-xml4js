                "  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is\npresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n",

                "  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field\nfluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,\nAmerican Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts\nthat the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate\nabout -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).\n",

An example is given for a\nthree-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are\nexamined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order\n(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the\nside with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by\nODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition.

In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric\nsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of\ninterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple\ncosmological model.\n",

Numerical methods were devised to calculate\nresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing\nprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were\nfound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high\naccuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for\ncomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock\ninteractions with a planar interface between different materials. These\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example\ncalculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects\nof plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and\nshock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.\n",

                "  We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy\nobservations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set\nof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the\nextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\n"

                "  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\naccretion curtain model.\n",

                "  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential\nequations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth\nfinite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\n",

                "  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,\nremains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.\nHere we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter\nwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\n",

                "  The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized\nstripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved\nBrillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that\nthe confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the\nlateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic\nmagnetization takes place at the edges.\n  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a\nwaveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction\nwith the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The\nexperiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the\nshape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the\nconfinement.\n",

We study the possibility\nof detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through\nmodulation effects in the $\\bar\\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock\nwaves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron\nfraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible\ndetectability of the neutronization $\\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\\bar\\nu_e$\nspectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant\nconversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for\nvery small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\\times 10^{-5}$.\n",

We prove that errors in any measured quantity are\nbounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when\nthe latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is\nsignificantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.\nTherefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller\nthan for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term\ndecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough\nscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical\nsimulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number\nof new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.\n",

Numerical simulations of light scattering by\nspheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and\n2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory.\nErrors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally\nincrease with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times\nincrease steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a\ncluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program\nis the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of\ncomputers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large\nparticles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current\nlimitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.\n",

Recently, Yndur\\'ain,\nusing an Omn\\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar\nform factor, obtains \\la r^2\\ra^\\pi_s=0.75\\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger\nthan the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\\`es\nequations, \\la r^2\\ra^\\pi_s=0.61\\pm 0.04 fm^2. A large discrepancy between both\nvalues, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\\'ain's method and\nshow that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under\ntiny changes in the input \\pi\\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for\nsome S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the\nresulting value is \\la r^2\\ra_s^\\pi=0.65\\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error\nin our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave\nI=0 \\pi\\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not\nyet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from\nQCD.\n",

In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal\nobject in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth\nisometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct\na spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold\nwhich is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the\nquantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups\nof commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum\ndouble torus defined in \\cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of\nholomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.\n",

                "  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice\nBoltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without\nblurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the\nsame work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes\nand finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction\nof nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar\nquantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)\nbased on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy \"trimming\") and (ii)\nbased on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical\nproperties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy\nproduction and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are\npossible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:\n1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven\ncavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.\nAll limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic\nquasiequilibria.\n",

                "  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n",

                "  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear\nperiodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a\nvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n",

This article describes an\nintelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises\na sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the\nlocation problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was\ntested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of\nlocation depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the\ndimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location\naccuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by\nthe conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the\nintelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is\navoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft\nframe structures by the acoustic emission method.\n",

                "  Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II\ndiscusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two\ncontinuous acoustic emission sources.\n  Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of\ndeveloping defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various\nstatistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is\nseparation and characterization of signal components when the signals from\nvarious sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source\nseparation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve\nthese problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability\nof ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission\nsources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for\nnon-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission\nanalysis.\n",

We introduce and investigate globally (or\nintrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most\ncommonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,\nLandesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,\nsemi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent,\n$C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of\nthe second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like,\n$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant\ncurvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global\ndefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various\nrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler\nmanifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved\nglobally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting\nidentities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the\ncurvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely\nglobal, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local\ncounterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special\nFinsler spaces considered.\n",

                "  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles\ntheory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well\naccounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from\npure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite\ninterlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive\ninteractions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals\ndensity functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The\nuse of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal\nparameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and\npotassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding\nseparation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are\nreported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are\nreported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal\napproach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.\n",

We use single site dynamical mean field\ntheory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong\ncouplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location\nof phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange\ncoupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive\nthe system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital\nsusceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce\nan orbital selective Mott state.\n",

But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle\nof unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to\nsurvive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is\nindeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent\nlife, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I\nshall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over\nantimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.\n"

                "  We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing\nbinary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf\nsecondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \\pm 0.000010$ days, with\nan orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \\pm 0.021$. We demonstrate\ngenerally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined\nbinary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the\nlight curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique\nline in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we\nassume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation\nhas been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line\nbroadening, $V_{\\rm rot} \\sin i_{\\rm rot} = 28.9 \\pm 1.0$ \\kms, gives a primary\nradius of $R_{\\rm A} = 1.28 \\pm 0.04$ \\rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to\nthe radius of the secondary, $R_{\\rm B} = 0.167 \\pm 0.006$ \\rsun, and the\nsemimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \\pm 0.30 \\rsun = 0.0351 \\pm 0.0014$ AU.\nOur single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the\nindividual masses, $M_{\\rm B} = 0.124 \\pm 0.010$ \\msun and $M_{\\rm A} = 1.04\n\\pm 0.13$ \\msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical\nmass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from\ndouble-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity\nto study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.\n",

The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized\ncosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to\ninvestigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call\n$\\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the\nsense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of\n$L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional\nsubspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine\ntransforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to\nthe study of sections of $\\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of\nthis class of bodies are obtained and examples are given.

                "  We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an\ninfinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is\ncomprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure\ncoefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the\nLittlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their\ncalculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new\nrule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in\nthe sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the\nproduct of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a\nstability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive\nformula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using\ncombinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from\nthat formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the\nmultiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general\nlinear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A.\nOkounkov and G.

                "  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory\nof free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical\nview-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg\nequations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for\nuniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some\nclass of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their\ngeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity\nof all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg\nequations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is\nsolved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal\nordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies\ncorresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction\nof the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation\nrelations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables\nis reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed\nthe requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum\nmean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the\nonly known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not\ncontradict to the existing data.\n",

                "  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for\nnanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,\nphotodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are\nimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two\ntypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also\nhave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is\nundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation\nbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation\nfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and\ncorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale\nrandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two\ndots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the\ncorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical\nfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and\nSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with\ncorresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature\na stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical\nanalysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.\n"

                "  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not\nnecessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\nimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\nrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\nsufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\nother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\nsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\nconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\ncontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\nwith the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the\nsmooth and holomorphic setting.\n",

                "  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way\ndepends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover\nmass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF\nimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values\n(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not\ndepend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the\nglobular cluster system.\n",

                "  We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite\nbackground in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an\nintegrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the\ninverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The\nresulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under\nvanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit\nmanner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into\ntwo kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies\nthe ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the\npolar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton\ncollisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a\ncollision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the\nprevious studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and\ndark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of\nthe multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.\n",

They are represented by the recently obtained\ncosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological\nconstant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages\nof expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within\nthe concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the\nbounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble\nsuggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and,\nsimultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of\nthe quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.\n",

                "  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of\nclustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\nshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\nindependently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.\n",

                "  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in\nspace-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the\nspace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\nconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\npp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\nbackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses\ncan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.\n",

When particles\ncollide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass\nand speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the\nasymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\\to \\infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the\nnumber of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our\nmain result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$.

                "  Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the\nprobability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by\nexperimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively\nby the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical\nlaw, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental\ndata by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the\nkernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The\nproposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy\nchaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict\na future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor\nerror is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is\nexpressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are\nused in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the\npredictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.\n",

These are nearly the {\\it maximum speeds} that are\naccelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even\nwithout the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of\nthe error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas\nwould not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with\nV_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x\n10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our\nresults are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of\n$4500\\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of\nAngus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter\n$M_{HDM} \\le 0.6\\times 10^{15}\\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\\le\n1\\times 10^{15}\\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.\n",

These\ninequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concave\nfunctions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama,\nand Kosem, respectively.\n  In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $|||\nf(A)-f(B) ||| \\le ||| f(|A-B|) |||$, and $||| g(A)-g(B) ||| \\ge ||| g(|A-B|)\n|||$, obtained by Ando, for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, also have a\nsimilar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answer\nexactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmatively\nin the special case when $A\\ge ||B||$.\n  In the course of this work, we introduce the novel notion of $Y$-dominated\nmajorisation between the spectra of two Hermitian matrices, where $Y$ is itself\na Hermitian matrix, and prove a certain property of this relation that allows\nto strengthen the results of Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem, mentioned above.\n",

(ii)\nHandles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black\nhandles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an\nexterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is\nshown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from\nthat with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat\nspace-times.\n",

                "  Modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due to\nquark-quark (antiquark) double scattering in nuclear medium are studied\nsystematically up to order \\cal{O}(\\alpha_{s}^2)$ in deeply inelastic\nscattering (DIS) off nuclear targets. At the order $\\cal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$,\ntwist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit\nthe Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon\nbremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon\nscattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark\n(antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the\nratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is\nnot negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The\nmodifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark\nannihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)\ndistribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark\ndistributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and\nantiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively\nexplains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron\nsuppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark\nannihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the\nlarge fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet\nquenching in heavy-ion collisions.\n",

At high coverage of TM atoms, ferromagnetic silicon\nnanowires become metallic for both spin-directions with high magnetic moment\nand may have also significant spin-polarization at the Fermi level. The\nspin-dependent electronic properties can be engineered by changing the type of\ndopant TM atoms, as well as the diameter of the nanowire. Present results are\nnot only of scientific interest, but can also initiate new research on\nspintronic applications of silicon nanowires.\n",

                "  Single walled carbon nanotubes exhibit advanced electrical and surface\nproperties useful for high performance nanoelectronics. Important to future\nmanufacturing of nanotube circuits is large scale assembly of SWNTs into\naligned forms. Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristine\nSWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for high\ncurrent, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallel\nSWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of\naligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymer\nfunctionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in\nan organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film\ncompression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and\npacking of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy.\nThe monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by\nmicrofabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowest\nregions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.\n",

                "  We study the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with\nnearest-neighbor and plaquette four-spin exchanges (introduced by A.W. Sandvik,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 98}, 227202 (2007).)\n  This model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a spontaneously\ndimerized phase to N\\'eel order at a critical coupling. We show that as the\ncritical point is approached from the dimerized side, the system exhibits\nstrong fluctuations in the dimer background, reflected in the presence of a\nlow-energy singlet mode, with a simultaneous rise in the triplet quasiparticle\ndensity. We find that both singlet and triplet modes of high density condense\nat the transition, signaling restoration of lattice symmetry. In our approach,\nwhich goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, the\ntransition appears sharp; however since our method breaks down near the\ncritical point, we argue that we cannot make a definite conclusion regarding\nthe order of the transition.\n",

The approach\nwe developed enables us to present a complete eigensolutions, which makes it\navailable to compare with the solutions under the RWA. We find that, the ground\nstate in our non-RWA solution is energically lower than the counterpart under\nthe RWA. If we have the ion in the ground state, it is equivalent to a spin\ndependent force on the trapped ion. Discussion is made for the difference\nbetween the solutions with and without the RWA, and for the relevant\nexperimental test, as well as for the possible application in quantum\ninformation processing.\n",

Electron and x-ray\ndiffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb\nlattice with a tensile strain near 10%.

At the\npumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of\ncoexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in\ncomputer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching\ndensity in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is\nclosely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange\nattractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the\nhigher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.\n",

At fields \\mu0H\nbetween 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V\nisotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show\na scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex\nglass theory. However, at \\mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down\nto the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in\nterms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may\nbe caused by a mixture of \\sigma band vortices and \\pi band quasiparticles.\nInterestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled\naccording to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent\neffect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.\n",

Here we capture magnetic\n\"fingerprints\" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain to\nvortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. As\nthe nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal\nstriking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis\nloops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity\ndistribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a\ncalculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm\nnanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the\nvortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and\nconfirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives\nquantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation\nand annihilation fields.\n",

Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate\naccurate light curves rapidly.\n  Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light\ncurves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected\nof published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be\nself-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of\nprograms which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects\nof the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are\nappropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as\nnecessary for a fading source.\n  Results. The light curve repository website\n(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and\ndeep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are\ndetected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data\narriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.\n",

The model consists in\nthat the vacuum is, briefly, filled of neutral but polarizable vacuuons,\nconsisting each of a p-vaculeon and n- vaculeon of charges $+e$ and $-e$ of\nzero rest masses but with spin motions, assumed interacting each other with a\nCoulomb force. The model has been introduced in full in a book (Nova Sci, 2005)\nand referred to in a number of journal/E-print papers. I outline in this easier\naccessible paper the detailed derivation of the model and a corresponding\nquantitative determination of the vacuuon size.\n",

The generated current is\nmaximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its\nquantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off.

The ratio of PAH\nfeatures and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower\nluminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs,\nsupporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge\nfar-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf's\nperiod of dominant QSO activity (Lbol ~ 7E13 Lsun) is coincident with an\nintense (star formation rate ~1000 Msun/yr) and short (gas exhaustion time\n~3E7yr) star forming event.\n",

Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are\nsolved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations.\nComparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the\nsame conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity\nprofile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of\nthe fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as\nviscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics.\nFor the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal\nviscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to\nnon-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be\nmimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.\n",

                "  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a\nnearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.\n",

                "  By combining high-resolution HST and wide-field ground based observations, in\nultraviolet and optical bands, we study the Blue Stragglers Star (BSS)\npopulation of the galactic globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) from its very central\nregions up to its periphery. The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the\ncluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such a\nbimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globular\nclusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations\nsuggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellar\ncollisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transfer\nprocesses in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial\ndistribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal\nradius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an\n\"evaporating\" BSS.\n",

The\nleading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces\nexactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term\nbehaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical for\nthe entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal\nfields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical\npoint). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional\nconformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and\nis related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.\n",

We show that the known Wegner--Houghton equation\nis consistent with the assumption of a simple superposition of the integration\nresults for +/- q. The renormalized action can be expanded in powers of the\nphi^4 coupling constant u in the high temperature phase at u -> 0. We compare\nthe expansion coefficients with those exactly calculated by the diagrammatic\nperturbative method, and find some inconsistency. It causes a question in which\nsense the Wegner-Houghton equation is really exact.\n",

                "  Vortices are pervasive in nature, representing the breakdown of laminar fluid\nflow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated\nwith a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\\Gamma=\\oint {\\rm d}{\\bf\nr}\\cdot{\\bf v}({\\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\\bf v}({\\bf r})$ is the\nfluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of\ncirculation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum\nis constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized\nvortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.\nIn BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including\nsingle vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent\nobservation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear\nsignature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In\naddition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear\noptics, and type-II superconductors.\n",

                "  The longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, in\nsemiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approach\nfor different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. Various\nmechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon\ninteraction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due\nto the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the\nelectron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine\ninteraction are included. The relative contributions from these spin\ndecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the\nspin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked\neffect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying\nboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either\nin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite\ntemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the\nFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high\ntemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the\nequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin\ndephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,\nthough the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.\n",

                "  The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond\nchains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0\n(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0\n(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is\ninvoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the\ntransfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore\nthe thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation\nfunctions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for\nthe three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks\nat wavevectors $q=a\\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero\nmagnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization\nplateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\\pi /3$ and\n$4\\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the\nzero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear\nsuperposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is\nobserved that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of\nthe system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the\nsusceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the\npeak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the\ncouplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings\nleads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,\nthe experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization\nfor the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with\nour TMRG results.\n",

The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability\ndensity functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose\nkernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)\nthe conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based\nupon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information\nand the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.\nWith the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the\nexperimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference\nbetween this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of\ndata represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the\ntrue properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the\nredundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number\nof data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual\ninformation is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the\nvariables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is\nused to indicate which variable is the independent one.

                "  In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium\nselfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\\omega$ meson we\ndemonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of\nthe mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian;\nmore consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any\nmass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral\nfunctions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay\nbranching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a\nquantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be\npart of any reliable theory.\n",

                "  The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and infrared line\nobservations require efficient modeling techniques to infer physical and\nchemical parameters such as temperature, density, and molecular abundances. We\npresent a computer program to calculate the intensities of atomic and molecular\nlines produced in a uniform medium, based on statistical equilibrium\ncalculations involving collisional and radiative processes and including\nradiation from background sources. Optical depth effects are treated with an\nescape probability method. The program is available on the World Wide Web at\nhttp://www.sron.rug.nl/~vdtak/radex/index.shtml . The program makes use of\nmolecular data files maintained in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database\n(LAMDA), which will continue to be improved and expanded. The performance of\nthe program is compared with more approximate and with more sophisticated\nmethods. An Appendix provides diagnostic plots to estimate physical parameters\nfrom line intensity ratios of commonly observed molecules. This program should\nform an important tool in analyzing observations from current and future radio\nand infrared telescopes.\n",

At low temperature the\nphotoemission spectra are strongly modified, with large band renormalisations\nat high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and a very large transfer of\nspectral weight to backfolded bands. A theoretical calculation of the spectral\nfunction for an excitonic insulator phase reproduces the experimental features\nwith very good agreement.

                "  We argue that the discrepancies observed in HII regions between abundances\nderived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines\n(CELs) might well be the signature of a scenario of the enrichment of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) proposed by Tenorio-Tagle (1996). In this scenario,\nthe fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined\nwithin the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only\nafter the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling\ndown and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these\nmetal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next\ngenerations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give\nrise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed\nORL-CEL discrepancy.

Out of the eleven zone-centre optical modes, six modes\nexhibit negative Gruneisen parameter. The calculations suggest that the soft\nphonons correspond to the librational and translational modes of CN rigid unit,\nwith librational modes contributing more to thermal expansion. A rapid\ndisordering of the lattice is found above 1.6 GPa from X-ray diffraction.\n",

                "  Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the\ncomplexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed\nfor its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the\nentropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of\nexperimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to\nintegration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy\nis derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about\nthese variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of\nthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and\ninformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of\nthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments\nneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost\nfunction. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is\ndemonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.\n",

For complex alloys like\nquasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practically\ninexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials\nespecially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force\nmatching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to\noptimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen\nreference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio\nmethods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co,\nicosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have\nbeen constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of\nspecialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.\n",

                "  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\\infty$\nfoliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and\nclassification of pairs $(M,\\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In\nthis setting, a classical result due to Reeb \\cite{Reeb} states that a manifold\nadmitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.\nIn particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these\nlines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \\cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a\nreal-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In\nthe present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To\ndo this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities\nand the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an\nelimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle\nconfigurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if\nother classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,\nproved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At\nthis purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\\F)$ of the foliation $\\F$, we\nconsider {\\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components\nadmitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\\F)$ admits\nonly weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic\nto $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of\na closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type\nresult.\n",

We simplify the study of the\none-loop lifting of the accidental classical flat directions by direct\ncomputation of the pseudomoduli masses via Feynman diagrams. This new approach\nallows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends the\nresults for the $dP_1$ theory in hep-th/0607218. The new approach allows to\ngeneralize the computation to general examples of DSB branes, and for arbitrary\nvalues of the superpotential couplings.\n",

The anomalous first-order character of\nthe transition to the spin-Peierls phase is found to be a consequence of the\ndifferent symmetries of the incommensurate and spin-Peierls (P$2_{1}/m$)\nphases.\n  The pressure dependence of the lowest transition temperature strongly\nsuggests that magnetic interchain interactions play an important role in the\nformation of the spin-Peierls and the incommensurate phases. Finally, a\ncomparison of Raman data on VOCl to the TiOX spectra shows that the high energy\nscattering observed previously has a phononic origin.\n"

Sensitive VHE observations are required\nto probe acceleration processes in this region. The H.E.S.S. telescope array\nhas been used to search for very high-energy gamma-ray sources in this region.\nCO data from the NANTEN telescope were used to map the molecular clouds in the\nregion, which could act as target material for gamma-ray production via\nhadronic interactions. We announce the discovery of a new gamma-ray source,\nHESS J0632+058, located close to the rim of the Monoceros SNR. This source is\nunresolved by H.E.S.S. and has no clear counterpart at other wavelengths but is\npossibly associated with the weak X-ray source 1RXS J063258.3+054857, the\nBe-star MWC 148 and/or the lower energy gamma-ray source 3EG J0634+0521.

We analyse several relevant questions which have not\ndeserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\\alpha$.\nReparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We\nshow that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or\ninadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the\nsingle weak phase $\\alpha$ just in the $\\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin\nrelations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\\alpha$\nthrough the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no\nrelevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most\nrelevant information, in terms of $\\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around\n$\\alpha\\sim \\pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New\nPhysics contributions to the $\\Delta I=1/2$ piece.\n",

The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a\nwide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission\npeaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties\nof the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are\nmainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by\nthe perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated\non-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about\ntwo orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the\nexperimental measured results.

We also demonstrate that due to the high\nsensitivity of the method, the small number of induced ferromagnetic Fe moments\nat the FeMn-Co interface is sufficient to obtain magnetic contrast from XMLD in\na metallic system.\n"

We observed that (10,10) tube can sustain its\nstructural stability for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in\ncompression at 300K. Bond breaking strain value decreases with increasing\ntemperature under streching but not under compression. The elastic limit,\nYoung's modulus, tensile strength and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10,\n0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature range\nfrom 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing\nwith increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher\ntemperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and\ntensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the\nSWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and\nsoftened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of\n300K to 900K.\n"

                "  We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one of\nthe two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By\nanalysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse\nproximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:\nQSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,\n$\\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\\vartheta=16.28$\narcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably\ncreated by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the\ncorresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of\nthe extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the\nUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three\nforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background\nmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal\nline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints\non the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars\nshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of\nthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.\nThus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in\noverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.\nFurthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative\ntransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed\nspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of\nQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.\n",

In the present paper, we examine the validity of [the\nSK assumption on the direction] of the incident neutrinos. Concretely speaking,\nwe analyze muon-like events due to QEL. For the purpose, we develop [Time\nSequential Monte Carlo Simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity of\nthe SK assumption. In our [Time Sequential Simulation], we simulate every\nphysical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation.\n  From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons\nunder [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained\nunder our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of\nthe direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside\nthe detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds\nirrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.\n",

                "  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather\nunexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots\nare extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein\nfunction in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein\nData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered\nones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most\ncomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that\nits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the\nproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and\nsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only\nappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of\nsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the\nenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a\nshort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a\nknotted structure in this protein.\n",

                "  We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of\nsingle electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model.\nThe SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's\nparameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing\ndynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling.\nSolving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,\nas well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found\nthat in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are\ndirectly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,\ndepending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation\nholds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating\nenvironment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no\nlonger holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either\nin the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In\naddition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the\nstrong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.\n",

We extend the analysis of James Lynch who was\nable to proof Kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of random\nnetworks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as in\nthe disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only\nfor networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the\nBoolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary\nconnectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns\nout that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\\lambda$ is equivalent to the\nexpectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct\nthe network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the\naverage sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased\nfunctions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only\nfunctions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.\n",

For the exceptional types, these\ndecomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$\ndecomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a\nsomewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$\ndecomposition numbers from results of B\\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on\nmap enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.\nThese results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and\nfixed integers $r_1\\le r_2\\le ...\\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\\pi_1\\le\n\\pi_2\\le ...\\le \\pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions\nposet, where the poset rank of $\\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the \"block\nstructure\" of $\\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies\nall known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing\npartitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain\nenumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.\nMoreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain\nenumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,\nin turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.\n",

                "  We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star\ncluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42\nclass II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I\nprotostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after\naccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census\nof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially\nwith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around\na B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery\nabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find\nthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that\nrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,\nstarless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population\nindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that\nthe IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its\nsmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While\nit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of\ndynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings\nsupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller\nsub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the\nsupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should\nnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.\n",

                "  We present the first X-ray detection of the very young pulsar PSR J1357-6429\n(characteristic age of 7.3 kyr) using data from the XMM-Newton and Chandra\nsatellites. We find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plus\nblackbody model, with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160\neV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 keV\nluminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy\nchanneled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed.\nThe Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and\nallow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of a\ncompact pulsar wind nebula. We do not detect any pulsed emission from the\nsource and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of the\nX-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar.\n",

                "  We have been monitoring Supernova (SN) 1987A with {\\it Chandra X-Ray\nObservatory} since 1999. We present a review of previous results from our {\\it\nChandra} observations, and some preliminary results from new {\\it Chandra} data\nobtained in 2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of\nSN 1987A with {\\it Chandra} reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originates\nfrom the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like\ndense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's\nequatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now\nsweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is\nrapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January),\nX-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\\rm X}$ $\\sim$ 2.4 $\\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs\ns$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-component\nplane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. As\nthe shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray\nremnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$\nthan it was until 2004 ($v$ $\\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$).\n",

                "  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the\nreceiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively\nactivates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\nfilter can require significantly more feedback.\n"

                "  We present new observational results obtained for the Galactic non-thermal\nradio source G328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar wind\nnebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties of\nthis source. Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray\nemission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a\npower law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the\nX-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than\nthe radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly\noffset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7\narcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio\nTelescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some\nareas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index\nof ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of\nL_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these\nobservational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a\nlarge PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model\nfor the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we\nconclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula\nformed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly\n(<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs),\nlow ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a\nlow density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.\n",

                "  Two-particle correlations have shown modification to the away-side shape in\ncentral Au+Au collisions relative to $pp$, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au\ncollisions. Different scenarios can explain this modification including: large\nangle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependent\nenergy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conical\nflow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle\ncorrelations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission,\nconical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the\ndependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can\nbe used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from\nQCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal\ncorrelations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles.\nResults are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction\nof combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction\nand the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications\nof the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones are\ndiscussed.\n",

                "  It has been suggested that X-ray observations of rapidly variable Seyfert\ngalaxies may hold the key to probe the gas orbital motions in the innermost\nregions of accretion discs around black holes and, thus, trace flow patterns\nunder the effect of the hole strong gravitational field. We explore this\npossibility analizing XMM-Newton observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783.\nA detiled time-resolved spectral analysis is performed down to the shortest\npossible time-scales (few ks) using \"excess maps\" and cross-correlating light\ncurves in different energy bands. In addition to a constant core of the Fe K\nalpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted Fe K alpha emission feature\nbetween 5.3-6.1 keV. The line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ks\nthat is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 keV source\ncontinuum. The time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted Fe\nline and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretion\ndisc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 M_sun. Given the shape of the\nredshfted line emission and the overall X-ray variability pattern, the line is\nlikely to arise from the relativistic region near the black hole.\n",

                "  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an\napproach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and\nrepresentation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\nin conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\nNP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.\n",

                "  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the\ndescription of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the\ndiversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be\nidentified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type\nin the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic\nobservations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)\n1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have\nbeen previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been\nobtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in\nNovember and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep\nslope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of\n0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence\nof a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some\nquestions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has\nnever been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected\nit. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused\nby the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,\ntogether with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16\nmay be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main\nBelt.\n",

                "  In this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding of\nthe combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms of\nFeynman graphs, and Dyson-Schwinger equations. Starting from Lie and Hopf\nalgebras of Feynman graphs, perturbative renormalization is rephrased\nalgebraically. The Hochschild cohomology of these Hopf algebras leads the way\nto Slavnov-Taylor identities and Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss recent\nprogress in solving simple Dyson-Schwinger equations in the high energy sector\nusing the algebraic machinery. Finally there is a short account on a relation\nto algebraic geometry and number theory: understanding Feynman integrals as\nperiods of mixed (Tate) motives.\n",

                "  Apart from its mass and width, the most important property of a new charged\ngauge boson, $W'$, is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions. Such\nparticles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. In\nthis paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling\nhelicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery\nchannel. We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution,\nreconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides\nthe best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires\nintegrated luminosities of $\\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV\nand provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This\nhelicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various\ndiscovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference\nregime, but with higher integrated luminosities.\n",

Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve\nbetter than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond\nwith careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric\nPLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope\nthat will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet\nmass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase\nastrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal\ncollecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy\nto 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass\nplanets possible.\n  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique\nvolume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter\nspace of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large\nradii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the\ntargets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active\nstars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,\ncoronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity\nwill extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric\nmethods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.\n  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods\ndemonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap\nfor exoplanet discovery and characterization.\n"

Quantitative agreement is found between the two\napproaches for the time-dependent cavity radius $R(t)$ at different solvent\nconditions while in the continuum picture the solvent viscosity has to be\ncorrected for curvature effects. The typical magnitude of the interface or\ncollapse velocity is found to be given by the ratio of surface tension and\nfluid viscosity, $v\\simeq\\gamma/\\eta$, while the curvature correction\naccelerates collapse dynamics on length scales below the equilibrium crossover\nscales ($\\sim$1nm).

We also show how the hydrodynamic modes in field theory correspond\nto the low-lying quasinormal modes of the AdS black p-brane metric. We provide\na proof of the universality of the viscosity/entropy ratio within a class of\ntheories with gravity duals and formulate a viscosity bound conjecture.\nPossible implications for real systems are mentioned.\n",

The effects of spatial fluctuations\n(non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting and\nincorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation\nis expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the\nbandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are\ncalculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond\nMigdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows\nmomentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order\nis suppressed at half-filling.

The study is\nbased on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensional\nHubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistent\nsolutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numerical\nrenormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is then\nanalyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these\nquasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, and\nalso from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found\nto be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\\bf\nk$-resolved spectral density can be understood in terms of the quasiparticle\npicture. We also find that Luttinger's theorem is satisfied for the total\nelectron number in the doped antiferromagnetic state.\n",

As an illustration of our\nproposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the\ngenerating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicity\namplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.\n",

In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking\nin the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.\nThis formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical\nproblems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the\npermeability of the {\\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked\nobjects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\\\"odinger form with the\nelectromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that\nthe electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially\nself-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily\nequivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium\n$\\var_0^{\\lambda\\nu}, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the\ncoordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the\nscattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the\nconstruction of \\cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \\cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and\nactive devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove\ncloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove\nthat it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.\n",

These properties can also be shown for\nvariational approximations that are generated within the framework of the\nself-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series.\nLuttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under\nwhich the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation.\nNumerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site\napproximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and the\nconsequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory are\ndiscussed.\n",

We create realistic\nmock galaxy catalogs by assigning luminosities and colors to dark matter halos\nand subhalos, and we measure the reduced 3PCF as a function of luminosity and\ncolor in both real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color are\nvaried, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the\nreduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from\nthe SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF\nmeasurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We\nexplore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated\n3PCF. The agreement between the model predictions and galaxy 3PCF measurements\nlends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDM\nhalos and subhalos.\n",

                "  We present observations and modeling of a lunar occultation of the\ndust-enshrouded carbon star AFGL 5440. The observations were made over a\ncontinuous range of wavelengths from 1 - 4um with a high-speed\nspectrophotometer designed expressly for this purpose. We find that the\noccultation fringes cannot be fit by any single-size model. We use the DUSTY\nradiative transfer code to model a circumstellar shell and fit both the\nobserved occultation light curves and the spectral energy distribution\ndescribed in the literature. We find a strong constraint on the inner radius of\nthe dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1.\nThe observations are best fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or the\ngradient derived by Ivezic & Elitzur for a radiatively driven hydrodynamic\noutflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS 60um flux without assuming a\nsubstantial abundance of graphite or by assuming a substantially higher\nmass-loss rate in the past.\n"

We start with a brief exposition of how\norbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used to\nunderstand their topology. We then show how these results can be used to\ncompute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplectic\nreductions.

                "  This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for the\nformation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the main\npredictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical\nperturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the\nevolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require\nbetter KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly\nconsistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial\ncollisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important\nproblems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.\nContrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids\nsuggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification\nof more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide\nadditional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and\ndynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate\ncalculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'\ncalculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and\nevolution.\n",

                "  (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak\nlensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging\ngalaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\nimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\nmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.\n"

                "  Spectral variability is the main tool for constraining emission models of BL\n  Lac objects. By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS\n2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore variability on the scales of\nmonths, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cm\ntelescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS\n2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval\nexplored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time\nrender our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.\nOn the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states\nof the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in\nthe literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the\nH band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the\nV band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary\nto the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of\nNovember we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability\nepisode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare\nwith t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.\n",

                "  We present broadband NIR spectra of A0620-00 obtained with SpeX on the IRTF.\nThe spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed\nbroad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of\nneutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the\ndereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H\nfor all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor\nstar, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In\naddition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with\nrespect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting\nthe spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison\nof the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO\nabsorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf\nstars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the\nspectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is\nobtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star\ncontribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with\nprevious published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al.\n(1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH =\n9.7+-0.6 M_solar.\n",

                "  The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength\nmonitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with\nflux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very\nhigh energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet\nmodel to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our\nmultiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce\nthe observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value\nfor the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due\nto the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the\nhigh-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence\nof a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role\nin the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to\nthe central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and\ngamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton\nemission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral\nvariability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis\npatterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day\ntime scales.\n",

                "  Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of\nplanetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection\nadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and\nreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated\nthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\nwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that\nthe host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary\nsystem.\n",

                "  We report observations of the dust cloud L1204 with the Onsala 25-m telescope\nin the 6 cm (1$_{11}-1_{10}$) transition of \\htco. The observed region includes\nthe\n  S140 H${\\alpha}$ arc. This spectral line is seen here in absorption against\nthe cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm\nmolecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO\nand CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant\ndifferences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly\ncoincident with the S140 H${\\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is\nclearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that\nthese differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.\nThe CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than\nthe H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily\nphotodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas\nlocated immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions.\n",

We then used this correspondence to give a geometric\nproof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model on\nG. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compact\noriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting and\ngluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition\nfunction. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum\nfield theory on surface graphs.\n",

Our observations show an intriguing picture\nof the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions range\nbetween 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the\ngaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this\nglobal trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved\nregions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is much\nsteeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gas\nmotions.\n",

                "  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the\nenvelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the\ndonor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative\nenvelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be\nresponsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate\ncomponents, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period\nbinaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct\nthe evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more\nproblematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either\nduring the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the\nfirst white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common\nenvelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive\nwhite dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents\ninterpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope\nevolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual\nformulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most\nplausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the\ncommon envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget\nexplicitly including recombination resolves this issue.\n",

We are able\nto pinpoint and understand the reasons for such and other discrepancies when\nthey appear. There is a subtle but important difference in the physics\naddressed in the two models. In particular if we reformulate the parameters in\nthe canonical model to better approximate the physics addressed in the grand\ncanonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to the\nissue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment in\nboth canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We demonstrate that this\ndistribution is very closely related to average multiplicities. The\nrelationship of the bimodal distribution to phase transition is discussed.\n",

                "  We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters using\nN-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in these\nmodels range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and\ninclude a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and\nthe tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a\ncluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late\ntimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the\ncentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time\n-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core\nbinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase\n(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in\nthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of\nmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces\nthe observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled\ninto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in\nstars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius\nup to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the\nexact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or\nless). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial\nbinary content of globular clusters.\n",

                "  Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event\nparticles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\nexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\nunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\ncode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\nimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\nanalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\n'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\nhadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless\nalgorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through\nreduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some\nmulti-jet observables.\n",

                "  A generalized twistor transform for spinning particles in 3+1 dimensions is\nconstructed that beautifully unifies many types of spinning systems by mapping\nthem to the same twistor, thus predicting an infinite set of duality relations\namong spinning systems with different Hamiltonians. Usual 1T-physics is not\nequipped to explain the duality relationships and unification between these\nsystems. We use 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions to uncover new properties of\ntwistors, and expect that our approach will prove to be useful for practical\napplications as well as for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics.\nUnexpected structures for a new description of spinning particles emerge. A\nunifying symmetry SU(2,3) that includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) in\nthe massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying the\ndualities of a large set of spinning systems, including those that occur in\nhigh spin theories. This may lead to new forms of string theory backgrounds as\nwell as to new methods for studying various corners of M theory. In this paper\nwe present the main concepts, and in a companion paper we give other details.\n",

                "  We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen\n(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white\ndwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an\nelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\nunless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\nearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\ncentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the\ncharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual\nexplosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).\n",

In\nparticular, we study the mapping of this solution to the parameterized\npost-Newtonian formalism to 1 PN order in the metric. We find that the PPN\nparameters of Chern-Simons gravity are identical to those of general\nrelativity, with the exception of the inclusion of a new term that is\nproportional to the Chern-Simons coupling parameter and the curl of the PPN\nvector potentials. We also find that the new term is naturally enhanced by the\nnon-linearity of spacetime and we provide a physical interpretation for it. By\nmapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study the\ncorrections that this new term introduces to the acceleration of point\nparticles and the frame-dragging effect in gyroscopic precession. We find that\nthe Chern-Simons correction to these classical predictions could be used by\ncurrent and future experiments to place bounds on intrinsic parameters of\nChern-Simons gravity and, thus, string theory.\n",

The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity\nscattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with\nincreasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon\nscattering.

                "  For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projection\npursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high\ndimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly\ndependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which\nis robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is\nidentified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of\nthe response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a\ngenuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for\nthe single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent\nand asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is\nsufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within\nseconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates\nwith the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive\nflow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.\n",

                "  Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmic\nrays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the\nextensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, the\nlight signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only\nattenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background component\ndue to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correction\nrequires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol\nphase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given\ndirection. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase\nfunction is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)\nlight sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of\nthe fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image\nof the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the\ndesign, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the\nAPF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.\n",

Traditional\nstudies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and\ncognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the\nphysical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,\nare described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently\nas information becoming more complex.\n  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple\nscales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,\npsychological, philosophical, and complexity principles.

It describes the buckling of a single\nmicrotubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly\naligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization\nmicroscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the\npolymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional\nforce. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity\ncurve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT\nbundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis\nimplies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.\n",

                "  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in\ntheir protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the\ncircumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has\nbeen unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\naccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\nitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\nsearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\nbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\nthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\n+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\ndays, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\nhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\nclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\nis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\npredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\nthose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\ncircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\ntimescale over which they might form planets.\n",

                "  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks\nhas uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.\nTherefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these\nnetworked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more\ndetailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of\nnetwork growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose\nan evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network\nstructure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network\nstructure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of\nthe network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the\nintensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial\ndisassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of\nnetwork evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting\nintroduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network\nso long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,\nit is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world\neffect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering\ncoefficient in a network.\n",

                "  Aims and Methods: We present the results of VLBI observations of nineteen\nGHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz. Of them, 15 sources are\nselected from the Parkes Half Jansky (PHJ) sample (Snellen 2002), 4 others are\nfrom our previous observation list. We aimed at imaging the structure of GPS\nsources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and studying the\nabsorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources.\n  Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources for\nthe first time. Of them, 80% show mini-double-lobe radio structure, indicating\nthat they are CSOs or candidates, and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us.\nThis result suggests that there is a high incidence of mini double-lobe sources\n(or CSOs) in the PHJ sample. The sources J0323+0534, J1135-0021, J1352+0232,\nJ2058+0540, J2123-0112 and J2325-0344 with measured redshift, showing\ndouble-lobe structure with sizes of <1 kpc, are classified as CSOs. Three\nsources J1057+0012, J1600-0037 and J1753+2750 are considered as core-jet\nsources according to their morphologies and flux variability.\n",

Magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using these\ntips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions. Here we\ndemonstrate that this spatial frequency doubling is due to the switching of the\nmoment direction of the nanotube tip. This results in a signal which is\nproportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM. Our\nmodeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in\nthe observed switching, and that it should be possible to image very high bit\ndensities with nanotube magnetic force sensors.\n",

Paying attention to the small quasi-one-dimensional anisotropy\nof the material, we take an approach from one-dimensional (1D) chains coupled\nwith frustrating zig-zag bonds. By calculating one-particle excitation spectra\nchanging anisotropy parameter $J'/J$ from the decoupled 1D chains to the\nisotropic triangular lattice, we find almost gapless excitations in the wide\nrange from the 1D limit. This one-dimensionalization by frustration is\nconsidered to be a candidate for the mechanism of the gapless spin liquid\nstate.\n",

                "  We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass function\nusing (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and the\nSersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured\n(spheroid) Sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy\nCatalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct\nmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for\nboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it\nstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type\ngalaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function\nwith a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope\n(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy\nsample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and\nintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local\nmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,\nearly-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type\ngalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The\nuncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include\nuncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the\ngalaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive\nblack hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.\nThat is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)\nh^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in\nsupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.\n",

                "  We study pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter (ANM). One of the\ninteresting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting for\nthe different charged states of pions. First we describe the pion-nucleon\ndynamics using the non-chiral model where one starts with pseudoscalar (PS)\n$\\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained via\nsuitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect\nof the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using the\nchiral effective Lagrangian where the short-distance behavior (Dirac vacuum) is\nincluded by re-defining the field parameters as done in the modern effective\nfield theory approach developed recently. The results are compared with the\nprevious calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). Closed\nform analytical results are presented for the effective pion masses and\ndispersion relations by making hard nucleon loop (HNL) approximation and\nsuitable density expansion.\n",

It is shown that the Kondo effect\nwill decrease the magnitude of the persistent charge and spin currents in this\nside-coupled Anderson impurity case. In the presence of SO coupling, the\npersistent currents change drastically and oscillate with the strength of SO\ncoupling. The SO coupling will suppress the Kondo effect and restore the abrupt\njumps of the persistent currents.

Calculated results establish Ti4+ valence\nstates (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Ti\nsubstitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the\ncalculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite\ngap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears\nat the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin\nstates contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic\nferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti\nconcentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck\nto achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.\nThis study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicity\nin ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based\ntechnology.\n",

Garvie \\emph{et al} [M. R. Garvie and C. Trenchea, SIAM\nJ. Control.

Based on that, the spatial plankton model is furtherly\ninvestigated by means of computer simulations and theoretical analysis in the\npresent paper when its parameters would be expected in the case of mixed\nTuring-Hopf bifurcation region. Our results show that the spiral waves exist in\nthat region and the spatiotemporal chaos emerge, which arise from the far-field\nbreakup of the spiral waves over large ranges of diffusion coefficients of\nphytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, the spatiotemporal chaos arising from\nthe far-field breakup of spiral waves does not gradually involve the whole\nspace within that region. Our results are confirmed by means of computation\nspectra and nonlinear bifurcation of wave trains.

                "  We report on measurements of the transverse fluctuations of a string in a\nturbulent air jet flow. Harmonic modes are excited by the fluctuating drag\nforce, at different wave-numbers. This simple mechanical probe makes it\npossible to measure excitations of the flow at specific scales, averaged over\nspace and time: it is a scale-resolved, global measurement. We also measure the\ndissipation associated to the string motion, and we consider the ratio of the\nfluctuations over dissipation (FDR). In an exploratory approach, we investigate\nthe concept of {\\it effective temperature} defined through the FDR. We compare\nour observations with other definitions of temperature in turbulence. From the\ntheory of Kolmogorov (1941), we derive the exponent -11/3 expected for the\nspectrum of the fluctuations. This simple model and our experimental results\nare in good agreement, over the range of wave-numbers, and Reynolds number\naccessible ($74000 \\leq Re \\leq 170000$).\n",

                "  Product probability property, known in the literature as statistical\nindependence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, all\nof which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature\nof the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic\nfunctional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon\nentropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having\nproduct probability property. It is argued that the natural process is\nnon-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in\nproduct probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the\ninvolvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function.\nGeneralizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some\nof the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy\nleads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related\ndifferential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of\n\"inaccuracy\" is also explored.\n",

In the parameter region where the phase transitions take\nplace, we observe that the lightest scalar Higgs boson has a smaller mass when\nthe strength of the phase transition becomes weaker.

The solution is derived by the application of the Laplace and\nFourier transforms in closed form in terms of the H-function. The results\nderived are of general nature and include the results investigated earlier by\nmany authors, notably by Mainardi et al. (2001, 2005) for the fundamental\nsolution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation, and Saxena et al.\n(2006a, b) for fractional reaction- diffusion equations. The advantage of using\nRiesz-Feller derivative lies in the fact that the solution of the fractional\nreaction-diffusion equation containing this derivative includes the fundamental\nsolution for space-time fractional diffusion, which itself is a generalization\nof neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and\ntime-fractional diffusion. These specialized types of diffusion can be\ninterpreted as spatial probability density functions evolving in time and are\nexpressible in terms of the H-functions in compact form.\n",

This analysis did not require the\nmodification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five\ndimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,\nwhich plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,\nand suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of\nconservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.\nThe resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of\nar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on\nkey cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational\nconstant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of\ngravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between\na four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and\n(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the\nspeed of light to the mass of the Universe.\n",

Local nano-friction\nexperiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine the\nevolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure for\nthe different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressure\nin the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent friction\ncoefficient is high ($\\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together\nwith ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa\nthrough some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 <\n$\\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm.\nThis low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes\nsliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the\npressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.\n"

                "  In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted\nto the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain\nunchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a\ndiscrete kinetic theory which yields \\textit{exactly} the fluid equations,\ni.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \\textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).\nThe purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse\nkinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this\nproblem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important\nrequirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that\nit yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but\nsuitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the\nboundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem\ncan be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial\ndistribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic\napproximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations\n\\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates\nof customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial\ncompressibility method are discussed.\n"

We present a general master equation governing\nthe dynamics of the translational states of the atom. In the framework of the\nDebye model, we derive compact expressions for the rates for both upward and\ndownward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates are\nperformed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of\nbound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate\nis shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep\nbound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.\nMoreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of\nmagnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.\nWe also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for\nthermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\\mu$K to 400\n$\\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the\nadsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the\nheating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-free\ndownward decay) rate is negligible.\n",

This behavior is in\nexcellent agreement with a recently predicted structural crossover in such\nmixtures. In addition, the repercussions of structural crossover on the\nreal-space structure of a binary fluid are analyzed. We suggest a relation\nbetween crossover and the lateral extension of networks containing only equally\nsized particles that are connected by nearest neighbor bonds. This is supported\nby Monte-Carlo simulations which are performed at different packing fractions\nand size ratios.\n",

                "  A number of giant HII regions are associated with soft diffuse X-ray\nemission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the brightest soft diffuse\nemission. The required plasma temperature and thermal energy can be produced by\ncollisions or termination of fast winds from main-sequence or embedded young O\nstars, but the extended emission is often observed from regions apart from\nmassive stellar clusters. The origin of the X-ray emission is unknown.\n  The XIS CCD camera onboard Suzaku has the best spectral resolution for\nextended soft sources so far, and is therefore capable of measuring key\nemission lines in the soft band. Suzaku observed the core and the eastern side\nof the Carina nebula (Car-D1) in 2005 Aug and 2006 June, respectively. Spectra\nof the south part of the core and Car-D1 similarly showed strong L-shell lines\nof iron ions and K-shell lines of silicon ions, while in the north of the core\nthese lines were much weaker. Fitting the spectra with an absorbed thin-thermal\nplasma model showed kT~0.2, 0.6 keV and NH~1-2e21 cm-2 with a factor of 2-3\nabundance variation in oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron. The plasma might\noriginate from an old supernova, or a super shell of multiple supernovae.\n",

                "  We present the results of a visible spectroscopic and photometric survey of\nJupiter Trojans belonging to different dynamical families carried out at the\nESO-NTT telescope. We obtained data on 47 objects, 23 belonging to the L5 swarm\nand 24 to the L4 one. These data together with those already published by\nFornasier et al. (2004a) and Dotto et al. (2006), constitute a total sample of\nvisible spectra for 80 objects. The survey allows us to investigate six\nfamilies (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5\ncloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The\nsample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception\nof the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and\nP-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the\nexception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is\ndetected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type\nasteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer\ntransition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans\nas compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the\nproperties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The\nanalysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows\nthat the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We\nperform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property\ndistributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in\ncomparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.\nTrojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher\ninclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.\n",

                "  Multifrequency VLBA observations of the final group of ten objects in a\nsample of FIRST-based compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are presented. The\nsample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics\nof radio-loud AGNs switched off at very early stages of their evolution or\npossibly to indicate intermittent activity. Initial observations were made\nusing MERLIN at 5 GHz. The sources have now been observed with the VLBA at 1.7,\n5 and 8.4 GHz in a snapshot mode with phase-referencing. The resulting maps are\npresented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some of\nthe sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore a\ncomplicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. One\nof the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio and\ninfrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object\nwhose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs,\nextending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The\nyoung age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolution\nscenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux\nof 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission.\n",

The conclusions do not depend on the particular shapes\nof the potentials and can be important in different fields of physics. When\nboth scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions for\nisospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the upper\ncomponent or the lower component of the Dirac spinor vanish, making it\nequivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case,\nbesides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angular\nmomentum as the (conserved) orbital angular momentum of either the upper or\nlower component of the corresponding spin-1/2 particle.

                "  The status of 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by Oppenheimer et al.\n(2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses\nundertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance\nmeasurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk\nobjects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo\ndark matter residing in such objects.\n  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white\ndwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the\nstars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August\n2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined\nyielding relative errors on distances of $\\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\\sim12$% for\n3 objects, and $\\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too\ndistant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our\nobservations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were\nderived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo\nmembership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be\nthick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based\nsolely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric\nparallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as\nderived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise\nthe halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a\nsubsequent publication.\n"

                "  It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with a\nhigh degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode\ndeformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to\ngravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications\nfor gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core\ncollapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,\nperformed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low\nT/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the\nnonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which\nshow that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the\ncorotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode\ndeformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are\nconfirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an\nimportant role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,\nwhich has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable\namplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.\n",

                "  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general\nnetworks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have\na fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These\neffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying\ntopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is\ndescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\n",

                "  We explore the effect of an inhomogeneous mass density field on frequencies\nand wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops.\nDispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in\nlimits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are\nverified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of\ninhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field\nleads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in\ncomparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This\nfrequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far\nas the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion\nrelations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of\ntorsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line\nwidths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a\ndevelopment of coronal seismology.\n",

                "  It has been observed that particular rate-1/2 partially systematic parallel\nconcatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor than\nthat of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can\nonly be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards\nlow bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a\nrate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we\npresent and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we\ncall pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate\nperformance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of\ntheir rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to\nsimulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the\nerror floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic\noutput. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of\nimproving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its\nerror floor.\n",

Specifically, we show\nthat for vertex weights corresponding to the free-fermion line on the phase\ndiagram, the emptiness formation probability is related to a one-matrix model\nwith a triple logarithmic singularity, or Triple Penner model.

The history of the\nelectron-phonon problem is introduced, and then study of the intermediate\nparameter regime is justified from the energy scales in the cuprate\nsuperconductors. The Holstein model is detailed, and limiting cases are\nexamined to demonstrate the need for an extended theory of superconductivity.\nResults of the extended approximation are shown, including spectral functions\nand phase diagrams. These are discussed with reference to Hohenberg's theorem,\nthe Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and Coulomb repulsion.\n",

So, there is some remaining space which geometry has been computed and\nidentified as a generalized Nariai solution. The thermal properties of this new\nspacetime are then calculated.

Above the metal-insulator\ntransition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra show\na Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1\n(185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in the\noptical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrations\ngives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below the\ntransition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of the\nlattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a new\ninfrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, which\nhas so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing a\nmetal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling between\nthe TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole moment\nof the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior of\nthe new mode.\n",

                "  In quantum mechanics textbooks the momentum operator is defined in the\nCartesian coordinates and rarely the form of the momentum operator in spherical\npolar coordinates is discussed. Consequently one always generalizes the\nCartesian prescription to other coordinates and falls in a trap. In this work\nwe introduce the difficulties one faces when the question of the momentum\noperator in spherical polar coordinate comes. We have tried to point out most\nof the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator,\nwhich has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentum\nexpectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation value\nreally turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentum\nexpectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angular\nvariables in quantum mechanics and the problems related in interpreting them as\ndynamical variables. At the end, we calculate the Heisenberg's equation of\nmotion for the radial component of the momentum for the Hydrogen atom.\n",

                "  The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: a\npure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propyne,\nrespectively. The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane\nand 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure\nmethane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to\na ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have\nbeen stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,\nwith a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration\nprofiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling\nwith a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and\ndioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,\nallene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,\n1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a\nPtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from\n700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,\nsome improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our\nlaboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main\nreaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6\naromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.\n"

To give an example we compute\nhere the imaginary part of the magnetic moment for the cases of the muon and\nthe neutron at leading order in the electroweak coupling. We also consider an\nanalogous effect for the strongly-decaying $\\Delta$(1232) resonance. The result\nfor the muon is Im$ \\mu = e G_F^2 m^3/768 \\pi^3$, with $e$ the charge and $m$\nthe mass of the muon, $G_F$ the Fermi constant, which in an external magnetic\nfield of $B$ Tesla give rise to the relative change in the muon lifetime of\n$3\\times 10^{-15} B$. For neutron the effect is of a similar magnitude. We\nspeculate on the observable implications of this effect.\n",

The primary aim is to establish\nsome almost-sure limit results for the long-term behavior of this particle\nsystem, namely the speed at which the population of particles colonizes both\nspace and type dimensions, as well as the rate at which the population grows\nwithin this asymptotic shape. Our approach will include identification of an\nexplicit two-phase mechanism by which particles can build up in sufficient\nnumbers with spatial positions near $-\\gamma t$ and type positions near $\\kappa\n\\sqrt{t}$ at large times $t$. The proofs involve the application of a variety\nof martingale techniques--most importantly a ``spine'' construction involving a\nchange of measure with an additive martingale. In addition to the model's\nintrinsic interest, the methodologies presented contain ideas that will adapt\nto other branching settings.

If the number of\nmeasurements reaches its maximum (the number of particles), quantum effects\nshow up again, giving rise to violations of Bell type inequalities.

                "  We study the potential of the CNGS beam in constraining the parameter space\nof a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\\Dmq_\\Sbl$. We perform our\nanalysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded\nincluding a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the\nchannel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter\nspace at the CNGS beam is $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$. The reason for that is\ntwofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation\nis the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for\nwhich both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an\nextremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\\nu_\\mu\n\\to \\nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile\nneutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is\nsignificantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.\nData from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the\nfour-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of\n$\\Dmq_\\Sbl \\gtrsim 0.1 \\eVq$, \\textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this\nmass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on\n$\\theta_{13}$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible\nexistence of sterile neutrinos.\n",

                "  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits\naround a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in\nQ, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.\nThis system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation\nreaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the\nCarter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of\nthese three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has\ncomputed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is\nlinear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in\nthe spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction\nfield), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the\nquadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric\norbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry\naxis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a\nsingle mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,\nto linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we\nshow that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a\nsystem (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional\nassumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric\nspacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.\n",

                "  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain\nwill help to understand its function and may provide insights into many\nproperties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to\ntheir dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex\nnetworks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and\nfunctional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks\nrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random\n(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that\nhave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,\nhodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network\nanalysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and\nmacaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark\nrewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis\nstrategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and\nconnections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain\nnetworks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free\nnetworks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck\nconnections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain\nsystems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'\nconnectivity.\n",

New population synthesis predictions\nare then described and, as an example, it is shown that the spectra of young\nstar clusters in M82 can be reproduced very well from 0.5 to 2.4 micrometers.\nWe warn of remaining uncertainties in cluster ages.\n",

                "  Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) living in the closures of\ndomains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability\nbecause of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic\nnetworks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and\ndirections of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for\nSRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that\nsatisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in\nthe defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial\ningredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for\nsolutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to\nshow weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance\nprinciple, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some\nsufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in\nconvex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the\npolyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries\nand possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.\n",

In agreement\nwith previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large\nenhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonant\nlevels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we make\nuse of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the\nphotoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the\nabsence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for\noligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is\ncalculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential\ndecay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a\nlength-independent value in the presence of radiation.\n",

In the Borel window,\nindependent analyses for the chiral-even and odd sum rules give the consistent\nvalues of the $\\Theta^+$ mass, $1.68\\pm0.22$ GeV, and the residue. The parity\nis found to be {\\it positive}.\n",

Moreover, there is a general connection\nbetween the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the\ncorresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability)\nso that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the\nimpinging beam for both structures.

Our simulation results have demonstrated that both central\ncollisions of the two extreme orientations can achieve full stopping, and also\nform a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume and\nlong duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sideward\nflow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly 3 times larger than that in body-body\nones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max}<0.5$, and that the body-body\ncentral collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2}=-12%$\nin contrast to zero in tip-tip ones. Thus the extreme circumstance and the\nnovel experimental observables in tip-tip and body-body collisions can provide\na good condition and sensitive probe to study the nuclear EoS, respectively.\nThe Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External Target Facility (ETF) to be built at\nLanzhou, China, delivering the uranium beam up to 520 MeV/nucleon is expected\nto make significant contribution to explore the nuclear equation of state\n(EoS).\n",

The latter\nequations can be obtained by means of the relativistic energy together with the\ncorrespondence principle, resulting in equations with a square root operator.\nBy coupling them to an electromagnetic field and expanding the square root (and\ntaking into account terms of quadratic order in the electromagnetic coupling\nconstant e), it is possible to calculate scattering matrix elements within the\nframework of quantum electrodynamics, e.g. like those for Compton scattering or\nfor the scattering of two identical particles. This will be done here for the\nscalar case. These results are then compared with the corresponding ones based\non the Klein-Gordon equation.

We estimate the\nimpact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the\nfirst galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and\nPop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the\nformation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is\nthe mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons\nthat escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and\nk_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.\nBy the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-\nphotodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the\nprimordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.\n",

We detect and confirm the protostellar\nstatus for the near-infrared source CB54YC1-II. The mid-infrared luminosity for\nCB54YC1-II was found to be $L_{midir} \\approx 8 L_\\sun$, and we estimate a\ncentral source mass of $M_* \\approx 0.8 M_\\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of\n${\\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source\n(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is\nconsistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B\nstar or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is\nthat the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high\ninclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central\nprotostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.\nIn addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are\nspatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source\ntemperatures ($\\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the\ndense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0\nprotostars.\n",

                "  Is it possible to understand cancer? Or more specifically, is it possible to\nunderstand cancer from genetic side? There already many answers in literature.\nThe most optimistic one has claimed that it is mission-possible. Duesberg and\nhis colleagues reviewed the impressive amount of research results on cancer\naccumulated over 100 years. It confirms the a general opinion that considering\nall available experimental results and clinical observations there is no cancer\ntheory without major difficulties, including the prevailing gene-based cancer\ntheories. They have then listed 9 \"absolute discrepancies\" for such cancer\ntheory. In this letter the quantitative evidence against one of their major\nreasons for dismissing mutation cancer theory, by both in vivo experiment and a\nfirst principle computation, is explicitly pointed out.\n",

We use considerations in the maximal\ncoordinate neighborhoods to give simple proofs of some of the basic facts about\nthe Delzant space, as a reduced phase space, and as a toric variety.

                "  We show that all static spacetimes in higher dimensions are of Weyl types G,\nI_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional\nconditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The\nconclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing\nhorizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\nproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\nwarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\nthe types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the\nsimplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,\npossibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that\nthe spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''\ntype D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are\ngeodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,\nhowever, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit\nnon-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in\nany n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D\nWeyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \\Phi_{ij}. In the case with\n``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''\ncase \\Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \\Phi_{ij} coincide with those\nof the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike\ndirections of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing\nthe twistfree condition and assuming instead that \\Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The\nn=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are\nbriefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.\n",

We use the Ds+ -->\nl+ nu channel, where the l+ designates either a mu+ or a tau+, when the tau+\n--> pi+ nu. Analyzing both modes independently, we determine B(Ds+ --> mu+ nu)\n= (0.594 +- 0.066 +- 0.031)%, and B(Ds+ --> tau+ nu) = (8.0 +- 1.3 +- 0.4)%.

                "  The existence of certain TeV suppressed higher-dimension operators may open\nup new decay channels for the Higgs boson to decay into lighter right-handed\nneutrinos. These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgs\nboson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays are\nsubdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopic\ndecay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks.\nA distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displaced\nvertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performed\nusing the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these novel\ndecay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimental\nconstraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the question\nof whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on the\napproximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.\n",

                "  We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD\n70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age\nestimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations\nof this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our\nspectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about\n100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored\nsince December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within\nthis period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a\nperiod of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of\nthis variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3\ndays. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff\nvariation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation\nbetween the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the\nrotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the\nlong-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass\ncompanion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial\nvelocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host\nstar, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which\nlies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.\nThe orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery\naround the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris\ndisks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.\n",

                "  This paper extends and builds upon the results of an earlier paper, in which\nwe described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deform\ngeometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry.\nThis top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions of\nsingularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related by\nonly a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And\nbecause the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the\nsuperpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of\ngeometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.\n  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of\ndeforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model\ncontent. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically\nengineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how the\nthree families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of a\nsingle, isolated E8 singularity.\n",

                "  Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are gas giants in\ntight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these\n`hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their\npresent orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we\npresent a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We\nfind that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface\ndensity. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is\nsimply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be\nobtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous\ntorque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by\nadjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at\nwhich the planet is released to migrate.\n",

As we found in\nPart A [hep-th/0703182], the integral homology group H_2(X,Z)=Z^3 + Z_3 + Z_3\ncontains torsion curves. Using the B-model on the mirror of X as well as its\ncovering spaces, we compute the instanton numbers. We observe that X is\nself-mirror even at the quantum level. Using the self-mirror property, we\nderive the complete prepotential on X, going beyond the results of Part A. In\nparticular, this yields the first example where the instanton number depends on\nthe torsion part of its homology class. Another consequence is that the\nthreefold X provides a non-toric example for the conjectured exchange of\ntorsion subgroups in mirror manifolds.\n",

Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum.\nThe lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,\nsome of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,\nhowever, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of\nthe present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \\AA\\\nwas about $5 \\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of\nthe observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of\n$0.06 \\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This\nimplies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale\nof hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the\nobservation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are\ngenerally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the\nbinary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical\ncondition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.\n",

Instead, we show that the main electronic role of the\nreduction process is to remove an anisotropic leading edge gap around the Fermi\nsurface.

                "  A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a\nstatistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 Earth-masses and\norbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to infinity. This includes analogs to\nall the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of\nplanets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provide\nresults on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with\nshort lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to a\nspace-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other\nmethods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive\nstatistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets\nthat a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet\nsensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of\nthe Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identify\nand determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of\nplanets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey is\nlikely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature\nof planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and\nhabitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is an\nexample of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these\nobjectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under the\nNASA Discovery Program cost cap.\n",

We conclude\nthat both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also\npresent high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a\nclose binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the\nsystem would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have\nunusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass.\nHowever, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on\nprobabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation\nrange. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that\nthere is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass\nassociation members will be separated in projection by <15\", so analysis of the\nwide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all\nwide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at\nthe 98% confidence level.\n",

We focus on the dissipative effects\nrelated to the expansion rate. At first order, we recover the expected result\nthat the decay rate is determined by the local temperature. Beyond linear\norder, the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansion\nparameter. This latter contribution is present even for stable particles in the\nvacuum. Finally, we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator and\nbriefly discuss applications to the trans-Planckian question.\n",

                "  We present new Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 148 extragalactic radio\nsources behind the southern Galactic plane (253o < l < 356o, |b| < 1.5o), and\nuse these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale\nstructure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that the magnitudes of\nthese RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the\nlocations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the\npresence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic\nquadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.\nTo quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider\nall available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and\njointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows\nthe spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth\nGalactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm\n(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in\nthe Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,\nin which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed\ncounter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent\npulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs\ndemonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not\nrequired to account for observations.\n",

                "  The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project is a survey for\nplanetary transits of bright stars. It consists of a small-aperture, wide-field\nautomated telescope located at Winer Observatory near Sonoita, Arizona. The\ntelescope surveys a set of 26 x 26 degree fields, together covering about 25%\nof the Northern sky, targeting stars in the range of 8<V<10 mag, searching for\ntransits by close-in Jupiters. This paper describes the system hardware and\nsoftware and discusses the quality of the observations. We show that KELT is\nable to achieve the necessary photometric precision to detect planetary\ntransits around solar-type main sequence stars.\n",

The two entangled\nqubits do not interact, but their state can change from maximally entangled to\nseparable or from separable to maximally entangled. Similar changes for the two\nqubits are made with a swap operation between one of the qubits and a control;\nthen there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control.\nWhen the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the state\nof the two entangled qubits is not completely positive.

                "  The Sun was recently predicted to be an extended source of gamma-ray\nemission, produced by inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic-ray electrons with\nthe solar radiation. The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuse\nextragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. While\nthis emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the\nsituation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed\nstudy of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for\nthe effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which\ninterfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon\nsignal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for\nemission from the Sun and its vicinity. The observations are compared with our\nmodel for the extended emission.\n",

                "  We present photometric detections of dust emission at 850 and 450 micron\naround the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA camera on the James\nClerk Maxwell Telescope. These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk\naround TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron\nflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)\nassuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes\nthe TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk\nreported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk\ndetected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly\nyounger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the\ndisk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the\ndust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures\naccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a\nmodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures\naccording to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in\nthe TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of\ndisks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs.\ndebris) as a function of spectral type.\n",

In this paper we\ndemonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that\nequilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For\nthis system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient\nthan constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering\nwhenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the\nbeginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as\nit is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense.\nFurthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.\n"

                "  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental\nproperties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray\nbinary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our\nwork mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided\nhigh-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably\nmodeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the\ndetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\nempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\nfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be\npre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion\nrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier\nsuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the\ndisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can\nbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color\ncorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra\nwith other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is\ndominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by\nstate-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.\n",

                "  Given a bipartite graph $G = (V_1,V_2,E)$ where edges take on {\\it both}\npositive and negative weights from set $\\mathcal{S}$, the {\\it maximum weighted\nedge biclique} problem, or $\\mathcal{S}$-MWEB for short, asks to find a\nbipartite subgraph whose sum of edge weights is maximized. This problem has\nvarious applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its\n(in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide range\nof choices of $\\mathcal{S}$, specifically when $| \\frac{\\min\\mathcal{S}} {\\max\n\\mathcal{S}} | \\in \\Omega(\\eta^{\\delta-1/2}) \\cap O(\\eta^{1/2-\\delta})$ (where\n$\\eta = \\max\\{|V_1|, |V_2|\\}$, and $\\delta \\in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial time\nalgorithm can approximate $\\mathcal{S}$-MWEB within a factor of $n^{\\epsilon}$\nfor some $\\epsilon > 0$ unless $\\mathsf{RP = NP}$. This hardness result gives\njustification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems\nin the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms\nare unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that:\n1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in\n\\cite{Tan02} for the analysis of microarray data, is\n$n^{\\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for\nthe Minimum Description Length with Holes problem \\cite{Bu05} unless\n$\\mathsf{RP=NP}$.\n"

A number of reactions using the dynamical and the statistical models of\nmultifragmentation, and the experimental isoscaling observable, is studied to\nextract information on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. It is\nobserved that the dynamical and the statistical model calculations give\nconsistent results assuming the sequential decay effect in dynamical model to\nbe small. A comparison with several other independent studies is also made to\nobtain important constraint on the form of the density dependence of the\nsymmetry energy. The comparison rules out an extremely \" stiff \" and \" soft \"\nform of the density dependence of the symmetry energy with important\nimplications for astrophysical and nuclear physics studies.\n",

With this model we can construct, for example, a\nsystem which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable\nphases. We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleate\ncompetitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a\ngeneral method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation\nrates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which\npredicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the\nnew phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate\nof a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases\naccessible from it.\n",

                "  We present an analysis of new Suzaku data and archival data from XMM-Newton\nof the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which has a strong soft X-ray excess\nemission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft\nexcess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines\nin the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton\nobservations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the\nposition of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant\nazimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally\nwell with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is\nneither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with\nmodels of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using\nthe data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not\nconfirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected\nproperties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed\nproperties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal\ninterpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated\nwith the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been\nprovided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying\npopulation might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.\n",

This phase is found to\ndepend on both the static B-field along the semi-classical trajectory of the\natomic center of mass and an ``effective magnetic field'' of the total B-field,\nincluding the oscillating rf field.

                "  We observe a sharp transition from a singular, high-mass mode of star\nformation, to a low-mass dominated mode, in numerical simulations, at a\nmetallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. We incorporate a new method for including the\nradiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,\nled to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to\nthe low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with\ncosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with\nmetallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The\nsimulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5\nMsolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core\nreveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4\nZsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with\nmetallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share\nmost of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass\nproto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=\n10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower\nlimit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second\ngeneration stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more\nmassive on average than stars formed in the local universe.\n",

                "  We use high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck Observatory to\nmeasure the stellar velocity dispersions of 19 super star clusters (SSCs) in\nthe nuclear starburst of M82. The clusters have ages on the order of 10 Myr,\nwhich is many times longer than the crossing times implied by their velocity\ndispersions and radii. We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive the\nkinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6\nsolar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses.\nComparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular\nclusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCs\nare a population of potential globular clusters. We present the mass function\nfor the SSCs, and find a power law fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06.\nThis result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in the\nAntennae galaxies.\n",

On the basis of the\nquasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structure\nof pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, and\nelectronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The\n\\pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortex\ncore induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances the\nlocal paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutron\nscattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.\n",

                "  About 25% of the Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit unusually extended\ncolor distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This\nphenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced\nsecond generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these\npeculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with\nextended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.\nThe GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by\nrandom motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.\nSurprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner\nhalo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the\nformation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic\nproperties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion\norigin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we\nanticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of\nMilky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.\n",

The\nSPM has been found to be consistent with cluster cellular structure, the flow\nof IGM from spiral galaxies to elliptical galaxies, intergalactic redshift\nwithout an expanding universe, discrete redshift, rotation curve (RC) data\nwithout dark matter, asymmetric RCs, galaxy central mass, galaxy central\nvelocity dispersion, and the Pioneer Anomaly. In addition, the SPM suggests a\nmodel of past expansion, past contraction, and current expansion of the\nuniverse. GR corresponds to the SPM in the limit in which the effect of the\nSources and Sinks approximate a flat scalar potential field such as between\nclusters and on the solar system scale, which is small relative to the distance\nto a Source.\n",

The three possibilities of the axial vector depending on\nthe metric function $B$ are discussed. The vector related with spin has also\nbeen evaluated and the corresponding extra Hamiltonian is furnished. Further,\nwe use the teleparallel version of M$\\ddot{o}$ller prescription to find the\nenergy-momentum distribution of the solutions. It is interesting to note that\n(for $\\lambda=1$) energy and momentum densities in teleparallel theory are\nequal to the corresponding quantities in GR plus an additional quantity in\neach, which may become equal under certain conditions.

                "  We illustrate through example 1 and 2 that the condition at theorem 1 in [8]\ndissatisfies necessity, and the converse proposition of fact 1.1 in [8] does\nnot hold, namely the condition Z/M - L/Ak < 1/(2 Ak^2) is not sufficient for\nf(i) + f(j) = f(k). Illuminate through an analysis and ex.3 that there is a\nlogic error during deduction of fact 1.2, which causes each of fact 1.2, 1.3, 4\nto be invalid. Demonstrate through ex.4 and 5 that each or the combination of\nqu+1 > qu * D at fact 4 and table 1 at fact 2.2 is not sufficient for f(i) +\nf(j) = f(k), property 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each are invalid, and alg.1 based on fact 4\nand alg.2 based on table 1 are disordered and wrong logically. Further,\nmanifest through a repeated experiment and ex.5 that the data at table 2 is\nfalsified, and the example in [8] is woven elaborately. We explain why Cx = Ax\n* W^f(x) (% M) is changed to Cx = (Ax * W^f(x))^d (% M) in REESSE1+ v2.1. To\nthe signature fraud, we point out that [8] misunderstands the existence of T^-1\nand Q^-1 % (M-1), and forging of Q can be easily avoided through moving H.\nTherefore, the conclusion of [8] that REESSE1+ is not secure at all (which\nconnotes that [8] can extract a related private key from any public key in\nREESSE1+) is fully incorrect, and as long as the parameter Omega is fitly\nselected, REESSE1+ with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure.\n",

                "  We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the\nspherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that\nthese phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface\nmodel is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model\nby using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.\nThe mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no\ntwo-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are\ncomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a\ncompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of\ntriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an\ninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside\nthe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.\nHowever, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;\nthere is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases\nmentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending\nrigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the\nfluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.\n",

Transition\nof the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation\ntransition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices\nare free to move.

                "  The equilibration of macroscopic degrees of freedom during the fusion of\nheavy nuclei, like the charge and the shape, are studied in the Time-Dependent\nHartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used\nto probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is\nexcited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric\nsystems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the\nfused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and\nvibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR\nenergy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental\ndata, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also\nquantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the\npre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be\nsuitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive\nbeams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.\n",

We study different coding strategies in\nthe single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the\nmyriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing\nproblem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the\nsource to the destination. We find that for a given route, the\ndecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative\ncoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by\nthe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative\ncoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms\nof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm\nruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that\nruns in polynomial time.

Here\nwe present another example: N=8 black holes (or black strings) in five\ndimensions and the bipartite entanglement of three qutrits (3-state systems),\nwhere the common symmetry is E_6 which contains [SL(3)]^3. Both the black hole\n(or black string) entropy and the entanglement measure are provided by the\nCartan cubic E_6 invariant. Similar analogies exist for ``magic'' N=2\nsupergravity black holes in both four and five dimensions.\n",

                "  We analyze a probabilistic cellular automaton describing the dynamics of\ncoexistence of a predator-prey system. The individuals of each species are\nlocalized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules\nare inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of\nmean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to\nan extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized\nby prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation\nis capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The\npair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of\nprey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and\nanother displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population\ndensities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through\na Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions\nand, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on\ninitial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more\nrealistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.\n",

                "  Intermediate polars (IPs) are cataclysmic variables which contain magnetic\nwhite dwarfs with a rotational period shorter than the binary orbital period.\nEvolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through\nthe 2-3 hour period gap, but it is very uncertain what the properties of the\nresulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are\nknown, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved\nspectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the\nIP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains\na white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We\nestimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \\approx 2 x 10^33 G\ncm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed\nshort-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest\nthat long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards\nshorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,\nwhich have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their\norbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with\nspin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.\n",

A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose a\nseries of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used\nas inputs of the KDEM.

                "  Aiming at a better understand of the physical and chemical processes in the\nhot molecular core stage of high-mass star formation, we observed the\nprototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 in the 862mu band with the Submillimeter\nArray (SMA) at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. The observations resolved the\nhot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial\nresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located\nwithin 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar\ndensities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows\nus to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature\nstructure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core\ntemperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial\ndifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced\nat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature\nsensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The\nSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this\nhot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot\ncore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for\nthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main\nsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the\nlarge-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the\ncentral protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are\nconsistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude\nthe outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative\ncauses of this velocity pattern.\n",

We calculate quantum mechanical ground states, low--lying\nexcitations and spectral functions of finite lattices by means of numerical\ndiagonalization. The ground state of the most thoroughfully studied case, the\ncriss-crossed checkerboard lattice, is degenerate and shows long--range order.\nStatic fractional charges are confined by a weak linear force, most probably\nleading to bound states of large spatial extent. Consequently, the\nquasi-particle weight is reduced, which reflects the internal dynamics of the\nfractionally charged excitations. By using an additional parameter, we\nfine--tune the system to a special point at which fractional charges are\nmanifestly deconfined--the so--called Rokhsar--Kivelson point. For a deeper\nunderstanding of the low--energy physics of these models and for numerical\nadvantages, several conserved quantum numbers are identified.\n",

                "  This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,\none-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has\ngenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput\ncapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not\nachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical\nnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities\ncan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is\nworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.\n"

This material presents\natomically flat surfaces, yielding spatially homogeneous spectra which reveal\nfully-gapped superconductivity with a gap anisotropy of 30%. Measurements\nperformed at fields of 2 and 6 T display a hexagonal Abrikosov flux line\nlattice. From the shape of the vortex cores, we extract a coherence length of\n31-40 {\\AA}, in agreement with the value derived from the upper critical field\nHc2. We observe a reduction in size of the vortex cores (and hence the\ncoherence length) with increasing field which is consistent with the\nunexpectedly high and unsaturated upper critical field reported.\n",

The LC\nmethod yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were\ndone in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of\nboth self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as\nwell. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In\nthe temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is\nlarger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that\nthis difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be\nrefered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic\nfactor \\Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for\ninterdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a\ngood approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic\ncross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under\nconsideration.\n",

                "  The most massive elliptical galaxies show a prominent multi-modality in their\nglobular cluster system color distributions. Understanding the mechanisms which\nlead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete\npicture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster\nformation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial\nvariations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &\nMatteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the\ndistribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric\nradius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular\nclusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the\nobserved multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can\nbe, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar\npopulations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population\nof globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very\ngood agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity\ndistribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of\nmerger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity\ntransformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model\n(abridged)\n",

Signatures of\nnon-thermal processes occurring closer in to the compact object can also be\nfound. In addition, three binaries are now established emitters of high (> 100\nMeV) and/or very high (> 100GeV) energy gamma-rays. High-energy emission can\noriginate from a microquasar jet (accretion-powered) or from a shocked pulsar\nwind (rotation-powered). I discuss the impact GLAST will have in the very near\nfuture on studies of such binaries. GLAST is expected to shed new light on the\nlink between accretion and ejection in microquasars and to enable to probe\npulsar winds on small scales in rotation-powered binaries.\n",

                "  The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a\ncommunication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their\nrespective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of the\nsenders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message\nbeing transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has\nadvantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding,\nis developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme,\nachievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian\ncases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate\nregions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the\nhigh-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer\nconsiderable improvements over these existing results.\n",

                "  IGR J11215-5952 is a hard X-ray transient source discovered in April 2005\nwith INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray\nBinaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data\nand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of\n~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic\noutbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of\nOpportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source\nbehaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The\nsource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th\nFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,\nduring a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure\nof ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a\nSFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed\npower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak\nluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of\nthe optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an\noutburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,\nand they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost\nquiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously\nthought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the\nbrightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly\nincreasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit\nwith many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous\naccretion.\n",

We consider a quite general continuous charge-asymmetric model made of\ncharged hard spheres with additional short-range interactions (without\nelectrostatic interactions the model belongs to the same universality class as\nthe 3D Ising model). The effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian of the full\nsystem near its gas-liquid critical point is derived from which the Ginzburg\ntemperature is calculated as a function of the ionicity.

The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed\n[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density\nlimit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and\nignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have\nlower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line\nflux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that\ndifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in\nthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit\nand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the\ntorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of\nextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line\nratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities\nassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We\nalso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended\nand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from\nlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from\nsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby\ngalaxies.\n",

                "  We argue that non-Abelian gauge fields can be treated as the pseudo-Goldstone\nvector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To\nthis end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the\nnonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mu\n}\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\mu})=\\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is\nconsidered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\n",

                "  The effect of possible in-medium modifications of nucleon-nucleon ($NN$)\ncross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions\n($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant\nrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\\it\ninelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and\ntheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+})$- and\n$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\ninelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,\nsince kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon\npotentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative\napproach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results\nshowing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a\nconsequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude\nthat particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear\nequation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its\nisovector sector.\n",

                "  During a crossover via a switching mechanism from one 2-body potential to\nanother as might be applied in modeling (chemical) reactions in the vicinity of\nbond formation, energy violations would occur due to finite step size which\ndetermines the trajectory of the particles relative to the potential\ninteractions of the unbonded state by numerical (e.g. Verlet) integration. This\nproblem is overcome by an algorithm which preserves the coordinates of the\nsystem for each move, but corrects for energy discrepancies by ensuring both\nenergy and momentum conservation in the dynamics. The algorithm is tested for a\nhysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of the\nalgorithm. The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MD\nsimulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows within\nexperimental error should be observed. The temperature and pressure of the box\nshould also be invariant within the range of fluctuation of these quantities.\nIt is demonstrated that the algorithm satisfies these criteria.\n",

The one-loop renormalizability is obtained\nfor the model containing the usual six representations of matter fields of the\nfirst generation. Even more, the noncommutative part is finite or free of\ndivergences, showing that perhaps new interaction symmetry exists in the\nnoncommutative gauge sector of the model. Discovery of such symmetry would be\nof tremendous importance in further search for the violation of the Lorentz\ninvariance at very high energies. Experimental possibilities of Z -> gamma\ngamma decay are analyzed and a firm bound to the scale of the noncommutativity\nparameter is set around 1 TeV.\n",

              "description": [
                "  It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been\nexpressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin\nwave function at filling factor $\\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the\nPfaffian wave function at $\\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\nvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and\nquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and\nstatistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that\ndescribe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general\nclassification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and\n$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a\ngeneral procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other\nfractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling\nfractions not contained in the principal Jain series.\n",

                "  We present an extension of the formalism recently proposed by Pepper & Gaudi\nto evaluate the yield of transit surveys in homogeneous stellar systems,\nincorporating the impact of correlated noise on transit time-scales on the\ndetectability of transits, and simultaneously incorporating the magnitude\nlimits imposed by the need for radial velocity follow-up of transit candidates.\nNew expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budget\non transit time-scales and the least-squares detection statistic for box-shaped\ntransits, and their behaviour as a function of stellar mass is re-examined.\nCorrelated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a\nsteep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, when\nconsidered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit\nthe potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we find\nthat small-aperture, wide field surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radial\nvelocity signal can be measured with present-day instrumentation in very nearby\n(<100 pc) clusters.\n",

                "  The star HE 1305-0007 is a metal-poor double-enhanced star with metallicity\n[Fe/H] $=-2.0$, which is just at the upper limit of the metallicity for the\nobserved double-enhanced stars. Using a parametric model, we find that almost\nall s-elements were made in a single neutron exposure. This star should be a\nmember of a post-common-envelope binary. After the s-process material has\nexperienced only one neutron exposure in the nucleosynthesis region and is\ndredged-up to its envelope, the AGB evolution is terminated by the onset of\ncommon-envelope evolution. Based on the high radial-velocity of HE 1305-0007,\nwe speculate that the star could be a runaway star from a binary system, in\nwhich the AIC event has occurred and produced the r-process elements.\n",

The\nSG cell has been identified using the magnetic network (CaII wing brightness)\nas proxy, applying the Two-Level Structure Tracking (TST) to high spatial,\nspectral and temporal resolution observations obtained by IBIS. The full 3D\nvelocity vector field for the SG has been reconstructed at two different\nphotospheric heights. In order to strengthen our findings, we also computed the\nmean radial flow of the SG by means of cork tracing. We also studied the\nbehaviour of the horizontal and Line of Sight plasma flow cospatial with\ncluster of bright CaII structures of magnetic origin to better understand the\ninteraction between photospheric convection and small scale magnetic features.\nThe SG cell we investigated seems to be organized with an almost radial flow\nfrom its centre to the border. The large scale divergence structure is probably\ncreated by a compact region of constant up-flow close to the cell centre. On\nthe edge of the SG, isolated regions of strong convergent flow are nearby or\ncospatial with extended clusters of bright CaII wing features forming the knots\nof the magnetic network.\n",

There is a\ndetailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions\nwithout disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs\nmeasure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force\nand diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.\n  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify\nthis transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to\nbeat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause\ndelocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap\nbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2\ndimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to\nlocalization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that\nin higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the\npinning force tends to infinity.\n",

It is known that any two unital $^*$-homomorphisms\nfrom $\\Dh$ to $A \\otimes \\Dh$ are approximately unitarily equivalent. We show\nthat, if $\\Dh$ is also $K_{1}$-injective, they are even asymptotically\nunitarily equivalent. This in particular implies that any unital endomorphism\nof $\\Dh$ is asymptotically inner. Moreover, the space of automorphisms of $\\Dh$\nis compactly-contractible (in the point-norm topology) in the sense that for\nany compact Hausdorff space $X$, the set of homotopy classes $[X,\\Aut(\\Dh)]$\nreduces to a point. The respective statement holds for the space of unital\nendomorphisms of $\\Dh$. As an application, we give a description of the\nKasparov group $KK(\\Dh, A\\ot \\Dh)$ in terms of $^*$-homomorphisms and\nasymptotic unitary equivalence. Along the way, we show that the Kasparov group\n$KK(\\Dh, A\\ot \\Dh)$ is isomorphic to $K_0(A\\ot \\Dh)$.\n",

                "  The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of\ngrains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,\nobservations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation\nefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by\nthe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller\ngrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that\nderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of\nsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports\nthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present\nin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.\n",

                "  We analyze 27 house price indexes of Las Vegas from Jun. 1983 to Mar. 2005,\ncorresponding to 27 different zip codes. These analyses confirm the existence\nof a real-estate bubble, defined as a price acceleration faster than\nexponential, which is found however to be confined to a rather limited time\ninterval in the recent past from approximately 2003 to mid-2004 and has\nprogressively transformed into a more normal growth rate comparable to\npre-bubble levels in 2005. There has been no bubble till 2002 except for a\nmedium-sized surge in 1990. In addition, we have identified a strong yearly\nperiodicity which provides a good potential for fine-tuned prediction from\nmonth to month. A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed could\nconfirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returned\nto ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolution\nof the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep.\n2006. The present analysis demonstrates the existence of very significant\nvariations at the local scale, in the sense that the bubble in Las Vegas seems\nto have preceded the more global USA bubble and has ended approximately two\nyears earlier (mid 2004 for Las Vegas compared with mid-2006 for the whole of\nthe USA).\n",

We found that the critical behavior of the resistivity,\nrho, in this clean system contrasts sharply with those observed in its\ndisordered analogue, NiS_{2-x}Se_{x} solid-solution, demonstrating the\nunexpectedly drastic effect of disorder on the quantum criticality. Over a\nwhole paramagnetic region investigated up to P = 9 GPa, a crossover\ntemperature, defined as the onset of T^{2} dependence of rho, an indication of\nFermi liquid, was suppressed to a substantially low temperature T sim 2 K and,\ninstead, a non Fermi liquid behavior of rho, T^{3/2}-dependence, robustly\nshowed up.\n",

To this end the diagram series of electromagnetic\npropagators is calculated exactly for an infinite bi-cubic lattice of\ndielectric and magnetic dipoles for a lattice constant small compared to the\nresonance wavelength $\\lambda$. Modifications of transition frequencies and\nlinewidth of the elementary oscillators are taken into account in a\nselfconsistent way by a proper incorporation of the singular self-interaction\nterms. We show that in radiatively broadened media sufficiently close to the\nfree-space resonance the real part of the index of refraction approaches the\nvalue -2 in the limit of $\\rho \\lambda^3 \\gg 1$, where $\\rho$ is the number\ndensity of scatterers. Since at the same time the imaginary part vanishes as\n$1/\\rho$ local field effects can have important consequences for realizing\nlow-loss negative index materials.\n",

                "  In the reaction e+e- -> WW -> (q_1 qbar_2)(q_3 qbar_4) the usual\nhadronization models treat the colour singlets q_1 qbar_2 and q_3 qbar_4 coming\nfrom two W bosons independently. However, since the final state partons may\ncoexist in space and time, cross-talk between the two evolving hadronic systems\nmay be possible during fragmentation through soft gluon exchange. This effect\nis known as Colour Reconnection. In this article the results of the\ninvestigation of Colour Reconnection effects in fully hadronic decays of W\npairs in DELPHI at LEP are presented. Two complementary analyses were\nperformed, studying the particle flow between jets and W mass estimators, with\nnegligible correlation between them, and the results were combined and compared\nto models. In the framework of the SK-I model, the value for its kappa\nparameter most compatible with the data was found to be: kappa_{SK-I} =\n2.2^{+2.5}_{-1.3} corresponding to the probability of reconnection P_{reco} to\nbe in the range 0.31 < P_{reco} < 0.68 at 68% confidence level with its best\nvalue at 0.52.\n",

                "  Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networks\nhave strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into\naccount a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is\nconditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the\nstructural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen\nin a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise\naffected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility\nof emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to\ndifferent inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas\n(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending\non the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is\nconsidered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local\nand global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly\nadapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis\nshows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply\nphysical sense- the term gas here used.\n",

                "  We study the solution of the nonlinear BK evolution equation with the\nrecently calculated running coupling corrections [hep-ph/0609105,\nhep-ph/0609090]. Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier result\nof [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running coupling\nleads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The\nrunning coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape\nof the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a\nconsiderable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the\nevolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is\ndue to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the\nsubtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.\nThese subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate\nnumerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that\nwhen the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in\nthe two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then\nuse the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find\nthe numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with\nthe running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very\nlarge rapidity.\n",

                "  We present new multi-wavelength millimeter interferometric observations of\nthe Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI, SMA and VLA arrays\nboth in continuum and in the 12CO, 13CO and C18O emission lines. Gas and dust\nproperties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent\ndisk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved\nboth in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar\nmaterial is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk\ninclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position\nangle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7\nmm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.\nThe dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200\nAU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and\nCO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,\nwe obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.\nWe argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is\nstrongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of\ndust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of\nlarge bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the\ndust distribution by a low mass companion.\n",

We present\nspectropolarimetric observations of the 8498 A and 8542 A lines in a quiet Sun\nregion near a decaying active region and compare the results with a simulation\nof the lines in a high plasma-beta regime. Cluster analysis of Stokes V profile\npairs shows that the two lines, despite arguably being formed fairly close,\noften do not have similar shapes. In the network, the local magnetic topology\nis more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than the\nphase of the wave, contrary to what our simulations show. We also find that\nStokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of the\nobserved amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly from the\nsimulation. Both the network and internetwork show oscillatory behavior in the\nCa II lines. It is stronger in the network, where shocking waves, similar to\nthose in the high-beta simulation, are seen and large self-reversals in the\nintensity profiles are common.\n",

                "  The search for MSSM Higgs bosons will be an important goal at the LHC. We\nanalyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs\nbosons with an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. This is done by\ncombining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on\nfull simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM\nHiggs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios\nin terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We\nstudy the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta\nplane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects\narise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via\nhigher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into\nsupersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\\mu$ can shift the\nprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by\nabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable\nwith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the\ndiscovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy\nneutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should\nbe achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM\nparameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSM\nHiggs bosons at the LHC.\n",

The WD distribution peaks\nat lower masses ($0.58 \\rm M_\\odot$) and shows a much broader range of masses.\nSome of the difference can be explained if the early post-AGB evolution is\nfaster than predicted by the Bl\\\"ocker tracks. Between 30 and 50 per cent of WD\nmay avoid the PN phase because of too low mass.

                "  The temporal evolution of step-edge fluctuations under electromigration\nconditions is analysed using a continuum Langevin model. If the\nelectromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and\nstep-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that\nsignificant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width\ncorrelation function occurs for a critical time $\\tau$ which is dependent upon\nthe three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\\gamma$,\nand the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an\nelectromigration force, $\\pm \\Delta U$. For ($t < \\tau$), the correlation\nfunction evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For\n$t \\ge \\tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is\nconfirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step\ndynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force\nacting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of\nthe statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate\ntime-scale.\n",

                "  Using local morphological measures on the sphere defined through a steerable\nwavelet analysis, we examine the three-year WMAP and the NVSS data for\ncorrelation induced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The steerable\nwavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to\ndefine three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,\norientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between\nthe WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The\nmost significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the\nsigned-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting\nsigned-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the\ncorrelation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and\ninstrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all\nsignificant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the\nISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced\nbetween the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the\nUniverse. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our\ndetection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for\ndark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future to\nhelp us to better understand the nature of dark energy.\n",

                "  In the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance two\ngoals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to\nthe Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a\nnew planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards\nboth of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is\nable to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet\ntransits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time\nbetween transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer\nthe orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass\nthat is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique\ncomplements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion\nresonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced\nsensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the\nphotometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV\nplanet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of\nhigh-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing\ntelescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting\nplanets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.\nA relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\\sim 0.5\n{\\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically\nincrease the effectiveness of transit timing observations.\n",

Motivated by the elastic network model,\nproteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume\ndefined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element\nrepresentation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that\nfacilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial\nresolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of\nT4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler\nbuckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare\nfavorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks\nprocedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational\nframework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates\nthe incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model,\nincluding aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is\nequally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to\nelectron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular\nassemblies of unknown atomic structure.\n"

                "  We study the effect of the coronal background in the determination of the\ndiameter of EUV loops, and we analyze the suitability of the procedure followed\nin a previous paper (L\\'opez Fuentes, Klimchuk & D\\'emoulin 2006) for\ncharacterizing their expansion properties. For the analysis we create different\nsynthetic loops and we place them on real backgrounds from data obtained with\nthe Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\\textit{TRACE}). We apply to these\nloops the same procedure followed in our previous works, and we compare the\nresults with real loop observations. We demonstrate that the procedure allows\nus to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with\nheight, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for\nloops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops\nare below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that\nsmall-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to\nimperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in\nespecially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright\nrelative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the\nability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do\nnot expand systematically with height is robust.\n",

Followup spectroscopy for randomly selected objects in\nthe sample with KeckII/DEIMOS shows they consist of [OIII] 5007, [OII] 3727,\nand H alpha selected strong-emission line galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z\n< 1), and Ly alpha emitting galaxies at high-redshift (z >> 5). We determine\nthe H beta luminosity functions and the star formation density of the USELs,\nwhich is 5-10% of the value found from ultraviolet continuum objects at z=0-1,\nsuggesting they correspond to a major epoch in galaxy formation at these\nredshifts. Many USELs show the temperature-sensitive [OIII] 4363 auroral lines\nand about a dozen have oxygen abundances characteristic of eXtremely Metal Poor\nGalaxies (XMPGs). These XMPGs are the most distant known today. Our high yield\nrate of XMPGs suggests this is a powerful method for finding such populations.\nThe lowest metallicity measured in our sample is 12+log(O/H) = 7.06\n(6.78-7.44), close to the minimum metallicity found in local galaxies. The\nluminosities, metallicities and star formation rates of USELs are consistent\nwith the strong emitters being start-up intermediate mass galaxies and suggest\nthat galaxies are still forming in relatively chemically pristine sites at z <\n1.\n",

                "  We report the first scattered light detection of a dusty debris disk\nsurrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the\noptical, and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. The most remarkable\nproperty of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme\nlength asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius,\nwhereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU. We find a blue optical to\nnear-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grain\nscattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of a\nlarge debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in\nthe Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics\nalone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical\nperturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115\nthat shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic\nspace velocity, and age.\n",

                "  Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB\nobservations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.\nCurrent limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <\n0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all\nknown string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level\nof detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may\npresent a challenge to string cosmology.\n  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation\nthat in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the\nHubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For\nthe gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an\nextremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r\n> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are\nsuperheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for\nparticle phenomenology based on string theory.\n",

                "  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a\nbehavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a\ndirected multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.\nIt has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is\nmanifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that\ncircuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients\nof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those\ncoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral\ndynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been\nstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.\nThe neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of\nexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in\nclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has\nbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and\nproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even\nbe impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible\nexplanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain\nhas been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential\nbehavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance\nto hemodynamics has been outlined.\n",

                "  We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths\nof supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming\ngalaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)\nabsorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.\n",

Besides recovering two previously\nconfirmed objects, we find six statistically significant candidate Ly-alpha\nemission line objects. The candidates are identified as having wavelengths\nclose to the DLA line where the background quasar emission is absorbed. In\ncomparison with the six currently known Ly-alpha emitting DLA galaxies the\ncandidates have similar line fluxes and line widths, while velocity offsets\nbetween the emission lines and systemic DLA redshifts are larger. The impact\nparameters are larger than 10 kpc, and lower column density systems are found\nat larger impact parameters. Assuming that a single gas cloud extends from the\nQSO line of sight to the location of the candidate emission line, we find that\nthe average candidate DLA galaxy is surrounded by neutral gas with an\nexponential scale length of ~5 kpc.\n",

                "  We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a\ncatalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS\nStripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz\nsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we\ncompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and\nstudy variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter\nthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g\nand r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)\nquasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted\nflux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the\n0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for\nfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high\nGalactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for\nquasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the\nvariable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main\nstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of\nlightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar\nlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like\nbehavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo\nsubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to\nexpected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that\nit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 million\nlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.\n",

                "  The boundary conditions of the heliosphere are set by the ionization, density\nand composition of inflowing interstellar matter. Constraining the properties\nof the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiative\ntransfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiation\nfield using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray\nbackground. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and\nthe hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating\nbecause of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible\nrange of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to\nradiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data\nfrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the\nheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to\nconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column\ndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the\nobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)\nand T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron\ndensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-\n0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, with\nsub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; however\nC is supersolar. The interstellar gas at the Sun is warm, low density, and\npartially ionized, with n(H) = 0.23 - 0.27 cm^-3, T = 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, and\nX(He^+) ~ 0.4. These results appear to be robust since acceptable models are\nfound for substantially different input radiation fields. Our results favor low\nvalues for the reference solar abundances for the LIC composition.\n",

                "  The observed association of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with peculiar Type\nIc supernovae gives support to Woosley`s collapsar/hypernova model, in which\nthe GRB is produced by the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massive\nstar to a black hole. The association of LGRBs with small star-forming galaxies\nsuggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the\ncollapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary star\nmodels are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive\nhelium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during\ncore-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few\nmillennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent\nevolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence\ncompanions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars\nin close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the\nstrong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain\nsufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.\n",

                "  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch\nelastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These\ndistortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic\neffect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport\nalong DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the\nelectronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we\nbegin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic\nstates in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations\nencountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are\ncomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states\nof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,\nusing previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic\nstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can\ndescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the\npresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the\nsubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which\nleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several\norders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched\nstructure.\n",

Effects of optical loss, group-velocity dispersion, and\nKerr nonlinearity on the position and momentum of an optical pulse are studied\nvia Heisenberg equations of motion. Using the developed formalism, the impact\nof decoherence by optical loss on the use of adiabatic soliton control for\nbeating the timing standard quantum limit [Tsang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 023902\n(2006)] is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The analysis shows that an\nappreciable enhancement can be achieved using current technology, despite an\nincrease in timing jitter mainly due to the Gordon-Haus effect. The decoherence\neffect of optical loss on the transmission of quantum-enhanced timing\ninformation is also studied, in order to identify situations in which the\nenhancement is able to survive.\n",

                "  Any color singlet or octet ccbar pair is created at short distances and then\nexpands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included\nhere in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of\ntransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and\nLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs\nvia two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet\nccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\nstage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the\nsuppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a\nbulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and\nthe ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an\nindicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest the\nrapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be\n-3<y<3.\n",

Allowable\npredictors are drawn from some specified class, and the goal is to approach\nasymptotically the performance (expected loss) of the best predictor in the\nclass. We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the\n$X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at some\nfinite bit rate. The encoding of the $Y$-values is allowed to depend on the\n$X$-values. Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,\nthe underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we\ngive an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor\nperformance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas are\nillustrated on the example of nonparametric regression in Gaussian noise.\n",

This Hamiltonian system containing\n1 degree of freedom and without constraint, gives Friedmann equations as the\nequation of motion, which describes a mechanical system with a variable mass\nobject moving in a potential field. After an appropriate transformation of the\nscale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant\nmass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the $\\Lambda$\ncold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds\nto a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into\naccount the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized\nstraightforwardly, but this is different from the approach of the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology.\n",

                "  Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signal\ntransmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical\nthreshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of\nstochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input\nsignals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small\namounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR\nin the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between\nShannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for\noptimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is\nachieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the\nnoise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal\ndistribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical\nverification and justification for previous work in both computational\nneuroscience and electronics.\n",

                "  Using a large galaxy group catalogue based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nData Release 4 we measure three different types of intrinsic galaxy alignment\nwithin groups: halo alignment between the orientation of the brightest group\ngalaxies (BGG) and the distribution of its satellite galaxies, radial alignment\nbetween the orientation of a satellite galaxy and the direction towards its\nBGG, and direct alignment between the orientation of the BGG and that of its\nsatellites. In agreement with previous studies we find that satellite galaxies\nare preferentially located along the major axis. In addition, on scales r < 0.7\nRvir we find that red satellites are preferentially aligned radially with the\ndirection to the BGG. The orientations of blue satellites, however, are\nperfectly consistent with being isotropic. Finally, on scales r < 0.1 \\Rvir, we\nfind a weak but significant indication for direct alignment between satellites\nand BGGs. We briefly discuss the implications for weak lensing measurements.\n",

                "  Aims: We analyze the available information on the star BD+43 3654 to\ninvestigate the possibility that it may have had its origin in the massive OB\nassociation Cygnus OB2.\n  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable\nspectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of\nits associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.\n  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous\nstar of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses\nand an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX\nobservations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the\nsky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches\nwell the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path\nacross the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest\nregion of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.\n  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway\nstars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A\nrunaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with\nour results.\n",

We use high resolution spectra (R=25000 and 60000) obtained\nwith the echelle spectrographs of the 6-m telescope. About one and a half\nthousand absorptions of neutral atoms and ions, absorption bands of C_2, CN,\nand CH molecules, and interstellar bands (DIBs) are identified in the 4010 to\n8790 AA wavelength region, and the depths and radial velocities of these\nspectral features are measured. Differences are revealed between the variations\nof the radial velocities measured from spectral features of different\nexcitation. In addition to the well-known variability of the Halpha profile, we\nfound variations in the profiles of a number of FeII, YII, and BaII lines. We\nalso produce an atlas of the spectrum of HD56126 and its comparison staralpha\nPer.

For the basic\nprocedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the output\nports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction\nof the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the same\nport with high probability, however large the initial state. When instead\nphotons are detected at both ports, Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states are produced. We\ndescribe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, and\nanother for subsequent conversion to a N00N state. Our approach scales\nexponentially better than existing proposals.

                "  The study of the innermost circumstellar layers around AGB stars is crucial\nto understand how these envelopes are formed and evolve. The SiO maser emission\noccurs at a few stellar radii from the central star, providing direct\ninformation on the stellar pulsation and on the chemical and physical\nproperties of these regions. Our data also shed light on several aspects of the\nSiO maser pumping theory that are not well understood yet. We aim to determine}\nthe relative spatial distribution of the 43 GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines in\nthe oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo. We have imaged with milliarcsecond\nresolution, by means of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, the 43 GHz (28SiO\nv=1, 2 J=1-0 and 29SiO v=0 J=1-0) and 86 GHz (28SiO v=1 J=2-1 and 29SiO v=0\nJ=2-1) masing regions. We confirm previous results obtained in other\noxygen-rich envelopes. In particular, when comparing the 43 GHz emitting\nregions, the 28SiO v=2 transition is produced in an inner layer, closer to the\ncentral star. On the other hand, the 86 GHz line arises in a clearly farther\nshell. We have also mapped for the first time the 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in R\nLeo. The already reported discrepancy between the observed distributions of the\ndifferent maser lines and the theoretical predictions is also found in R Leo.\n",

                "  The polarized neutron scattering in helimagnetic MnSi at low $T$ reveals\nexistence of a partially disordered chiral state at ambient pressure in the\nmagnetic field applied along $<111>$ axis below the first order transition to\nthe non-chiral ferromagnetic state. This unexpected phenomenon is explained by\nthe analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of the\nspin-wave gap becomes negative under magnetic field applied along $<111>$ and\n$<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competition\nbetween the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy. This negative sign\nmeans an instability of the spin wave spectrum for the helix and leads to a\ndestruction of the helical order, giving rise to the partially disordered state\nbelow the first order ferromagnetic transition.\n",

We examined the\ndifferent definitions and identified the similarities and differences between\nthem. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the\nweighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of\nthe connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm\nof the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study\nrevealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative\nperturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weighted\ngraphs.\n",

For the shape consisting of $n=\\omega_d r^d$\nsites, where $\\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\R^d$, we show that\nthe inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\\log r)$, while the\noutradius is at most $r+O(r^\\alpha)$ for any $\\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related\nmodel, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a\nEuclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total\nmass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\\pi\nr^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\\sqrt{3}$, and the\noutradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\\sqrt{2}$.

                "  We construct general 2-charge D1-D5 horizon-free non-singular solutions of\nIIB supergravity on T^4 and K3 describing fuzzballs with excitations in the\ninternal manifold; these excitations are characterized by arbitrary curves. The\nsolutions are obtained via dualities from F1-P solutions of heterotic and type\nIIB on T^4 for the K3 and T^4 cases, respectively. We compute the holographic\ndata encoded in these solutions, and show that the internal excitations are\ncaptured by vevs of chiral primaries associated with the middle cohomology of\nT^4 or K3. We argue that each geometry is dual to a specific superposition of R\nground states determined in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the curves\ndefining the supergravity solution. We compute vevs of chiral primaries\nassociated with the middle cohomology and show that they indeed acquire vevs in\nthe superpositions corresponding to fuzzballs with internal excitations, in\naccordance with the holographic results. We also address the question of\nwhether the fuzzball program can be implemented consistently within\nsupergravity.\n",

The\nuse of these properties allows rigorous derivation and simplification of the\nexpressions of the frequency matrix (FM) and of the generalized mean field\napproximation (GMFA) Green functions (GFs) of the model.\n  For the normal singlet hopping and anomalous exchange pairing correlation\nfunctions which enter the FM and GMFA-GFs, an approximation procedure based on\nthe identification and elimination of exponentially small quantities is\ndescribed.

To this end, we introduce non-renormalizable interactions with a\nflavor democratic structure to the fermion mass generation sector. It is found\nthat at least two iso-singlet scalar fields with imposed a discrete symmetry\nare necessary to generate CP violation due to the appearance of the relative\nphase between their vacuum expectation values.\n  In the simplest model, ratios of quark masses and the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix including the CP violating phase are\ndetermined by the CKM element |V_{us}| and the ratio of two vacuum expectation\nvalues R=|R|e^{i*alpha} (a magnitude and a phase). It is demonstrated how the\nangles phi_i (i=1--3) of the unitarity triangle and the CKM off-diagonal\nelements |V_{ub}| and |V_{cb}| are predicted as a function of |V_{us}|, |R| and\n\\alpha. Although the predicted value of the CP violating phase does not agree\nwith the experimental data within the simplest model, the basic idea of our\nscenario would be promising to construct a more realistic model of flavor and\nCP violation.\n",

                "  We study a heavy piston of mass $M$ that moves in one dimension. The piston\nseparates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unit\nmass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\\geq 1$. Using averaging\ntechniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in\nprobability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $\nwhen $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and\nthe number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed\nout that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.\n  When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that\nthe rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged\nbehavior is $\\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The\nconvergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also\ninvestigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been\nsmoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,\nboth over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.\n  In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons\nseparating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of\naveraging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging\nresults. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem\nfor smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.\n",

                "  This work reports a theoretical study of the gas phase unimolecular\ndecomposition of cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane by means of quantum\nchemical calculations. A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for each\ncycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formed\nhave been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data\n(\\delta H^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) for all the involved species have been obtained by\nmeans of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also been\nincluded. Activation barriers of each reaction have been analyzed to assess the\n1 energetically most favorable pathways for the decomposition of biradicals.\nRate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transition\nstate theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. Global rate\nconstant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products have\nbeen calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowed\nto validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that the\nrotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are of\nimportance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals. Ring strain\nenergies (RSE) in transition states for ring opening have been estimated and\nshow that the main part of RSE contained in the cyclic reactants is removed\nupon the activation process.\n"

A large part of this review provides however general\ninformation applicable to any kind of solid-state laser. Our aim here is not to\nmake a list of the techniques that have been used to minimize thermal effects,\nbut instead to give an overview of the theoretical aspects underneath, and give\na state-of-the-art of the tools at the disposal of the laser scientist to\nmeasure thermal effects. After a presentation of some general properties of\nYb-doped materials, we address the issue of evaluating the temperature map in\nYb-doped laser crystals, both theoretically and experimentally. This is the\nfirst step before studying the complex problem of thermal lensing (part III).\nWe will focus on some newly discussed aspects, like the definition of the\nthermo-optic coefficient: we will highlight some misleading interpretations of\nthermal lensing experiments due to the use of the dn/dT parameter in a context\nwhere it is not relevant. Part IV will be devoted to a state-of-the-art of\nexperimental techniques used to measure thermal lensing. Eventually, in part V,\nwe will give some concrete examples in Yb-doped materials, where their\npeculiarities will be pointed out.\n"

It is\nshown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent\nto replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic\nexpression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well\nthe asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient\nsurface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this\nmodel and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient\n\"near-zone\" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,\nit is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes\nthe asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient\nnear-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and\noptimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part\nwill be controlled by surface waves.\n",

The numerical calculations are performed\nwithin the relativistic optical model eikonal approximation. The nuclear\ntransparency results indicate that the effect of the second-order eikonal\ncorrections is rather modest, even at $Q^{2} \\approx 0.2$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The same\napplies to polarization observables, left-right asymmetries, and differential\ncross sections at low missing momenta.

                "  We present a serendipitous detection of the infrared-bright supernova remnant\n(SNR) B0104-72.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud by the Infrared Camera (IRC)\nonboard AKARI. An elongated, partially complete shell is detected in all four\nobserved IRC bands covering 2.6-15 um. The infrared shell surrounds radio,\noptical, and X-ray emission associated with the SNR and is probably a radiative\nSNR shell. This is the first detection of a SNR shell in this near/mid-infrared\nwaveband in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The IRC color indicates that the\ninfrared emission might be from shocked H2 molecules with some possible\ncontributions from ionic lines. We conclude that B0104-72.3 is a middle-aged\nSNR interacting with molecular clouds, similar to the Galactic SNR IC 443. Our\nresults highlight the potential of AKARI IRC observations in studying SNRs,\nespecially for diagnosing SNR shocks.\n",

A Flory-Huggins model is solved to determine\nthe effects of heterogeneity in modification on the solubility of such\npolymers. It is found that heterogeneity leads to decreased solubility, with\nthe effect increasing with increasing blockiness. In the limit of extreme\nblockiness, the nature of the phase coexistence crosses over to a\npolymer-polymer demixing transition. Some consequences are discussed for the\nsynthesis of partially modified polymers, and the experimental characterisation\nof such systems.\n",

This inverse problem - known as electrical\nimpedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has\nfocussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,\nno work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper\naims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative\nof the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface\n$\\partial\\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the\ngeometry of $\\partial \\omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives\nneeded to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the\nstability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely\nill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.\n"

A particle motion in\nthis system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface\ndensity of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,\nwe sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle\nmotion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a\nfinite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these\ndifferent chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we\ninvestigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that\nsuch a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy\nspectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different\nfrom that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This\nsuggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of\nthe orbit via the gravitational waves.\n",

                "  Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have\nsuggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope\nnear zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black\nhole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\ninterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is\nsimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at\nwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between\n`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does\nhave a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN\nand GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an\nimproved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on\nconsiderably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of\ncontinuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well\nfitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.\nAlthough a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by\nadding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not\nunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second\nbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate\nimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found\nin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other\nAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.\n",

The propagators and the\nFaddeev-Popov operator behave as expected from the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario.\nIn addition, finite volume effects affecting these Green's functions are\ninvestigated systematically. The critical infrared exponents of the\npropagators, as proposed in calculations using stochastic quantization and\nDyson-Schwinger equations, are confirmed quantitatively. For this purpose\nlattices of volume up to (42.7 fm)^2 have been used.\n",

We derive the electrical and energy currents of\nthe coupled electron-phonon system and the energy exchange between them. As an\napplication, we study the heat dissipation in current carrying atomic junctions\nwithin the self-consistent Born approximation, which guarantees energy current\nconservation.

We examine these two phenomena by\nextending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. We\nfind that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating\nmedium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular\nmomentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum\naccount respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of\nthe transmitted image.\n",

In this\nview we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges\n(1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those\nfor shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to\nlong-range correlations and a broad probability density function.

For the boosted black string, this effective tension is always\npositive, while the ADM tension is negative for large boost parameter. We also\nderive two Smarr formulas, one that follows from time translation invariance,\nand a second one that holds only in the case of exact translation symmetry in\nthe compact dimension.

                "  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links\nmakes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to\nkeep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.\nSampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by\nthe collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating\nflow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all\ncases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a\nper-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the\ncollected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant\nfor some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.\nHowever, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative\naccuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of\nsampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the\noriginal traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the\nimpact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.\nIn this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in\nNetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss\nof monitoring detail.\n"

                "  We perform a systematic study of the impact of the J^2 tensor term in the\nSkyrme energy functional on properties of spherical nuclei. In the Skyrme\nenergy functional, the tensor terms originate both from zero-range central and\ntensor forces. We build a set of 36 parameterizations, which covers a wide\nrange of the parameter space of the isoscalar and isovector tensor term\ncoupling constants, with a fit protocol very similar to that of the successful\nSLy parameterizations. We analyze the impact of the tensor terms on a large\nvariety of observables in spherical mean-field calculations, such as the\nspin-orbit splittings and single-particle spectra of doubly-magic nuclei, the\nevolution of spin-orbit splittings along chains of semi-magic nuclei, mass\nresiduals of spherical nuclei, and known anomalies of charge radii. Our main\nconclusion is that the currently used central and spin-orbit parts of the\nSkyrme energy density functional are not flexible enough to allow for the\npresence of large tensor terms.\n",

The observed SEDs are\nmodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using\nthe phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated\nwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red\nquasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are\nused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black\nholes residing in these AGN.\n  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)\nbands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed\nnear- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the\nrange ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is\n~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994).\nFor the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the K_s band, we derive high\nstellar masses (0.8-6.2)X10^11 Mo, black hole masses in the range\n(0.2-2.5)X10^9 Mo, and Eddington ratios L/L_Edd<0.1, suggesting a low-accretion\nphase.\n",

We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a\nrefinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This\nequation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is\nthe sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.\nThe case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real\nHaar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function\ngenerating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real\nrefinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different\n2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\\cL}^2(\\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar\nMRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential\noperators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be\nintensively used for applications.\n"

                "  We subject the phenomenologically successful large volume scenario of\nhep-th/0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, we\nconsider whether the expansion of the string effective action is consistent in\nthe presence of D-branes and O-planes. Due to the no-scale structure at\ntree-level, the scenario is surprisingly robust. We compute the modification of\nsoft supersymmetry breaking terms, and find only subleading corrections. We\nalso comment that for large-volume limits of toroidal orientifolds and fibered\nCalabi-Yau manifolds the corrections can be more important, and we discuss\nfurther checks that need to be performed.\n",

We consider models with the same circular\nvelocity in the equatorial plane (purely baryonic disks in MOND and the same\ndisks in Newtonian gravity embedded in spherical dark matter haloes), and we\nconstruct their intrinsic and projected kinematical fields by solving the Jeans\nequations under the assumption of a two-integral distribution function. We\nfound that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much\nlarger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the more\nrealistic case of high-surface density disks this effect is significantly\nreduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND and\nNewtonian gravity with dark matter by using current observations.\n",

The correction is related to the spectral\ndeterminant of the Laplace operator. The case of a large square metallic\nnetwork is considered. The variation of $\\Delta\\sigma_\\mathrm{ee}(L_T)$ as a\nfunction of the thermal length $L_T$ is found very similar to the variation of\nthe weak localization $\\Delta\\sigma_\\mathrm{WL}(L_\\phi)$ as a function of the\nphase coherence length. Our result for $\\Delta\\sigma_\\mathrm{ee}$ interpolates\nbetween the known 1d and 2d results, but the interaction parameter entering the\nexpression of $\\Delta\\sigma_\\mathrm{ee}$ keeps a 1d behaviour. Quite\nsurprisingly, the result is very close to the 2d logarithmic behaviour already\nfor $L_T\\sim{a}/2$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter.\n",

                "  The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in\ncomplex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,\nfamilies, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent\nchanges in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the\nassociated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.\nOur knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is\nlimited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and\nself-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm\nbased on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate\nthe time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to\nuncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on\nnetworks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between\nmobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are\ncapable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to\nchange the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small\ngroups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that\ntheir composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the\ntime commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating\nthe community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental\ndifferences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.\n",

                "  We apply results of Malliavin-Thalmaier-Watanabe for strong and weak Taylor\nexpansions of solutions of perturbed stochastic differential equations (SDEs).\nIn particular, we work out weight expressions for the Taylor coefficients of\nthe expansion. The results are applied to LIBOR market models in order to deal\nwith the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility. In contrast\nto other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full SDE, we obtain\neasily tractable expressions for accurate pricing. In particular, we present an\neasily tractable alternative to ``freezing the drift'' in LIBOR market models,\nwhich has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme. Numerical examples\nunderline the results.\n",

The visibility presents a single side lobe\nstructure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance is\nquadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statistical\nmethod, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibits\nthe same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsic\ncharacter of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of the\nimpinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.\n",

                "  In braneworld cosmology the expanding Universe is realized as a brane moving\nthrough a warped higher-dimensional spacetime. Like a moving mirror causes the\ncreation of photons out of vacuum fluctuations, a moving brane leads to\ngraviton production. We show that, very generically, Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nparticles scale like stiff matter with the expansion of the Universe and can\ntherefore not represent the dark matter in a warped braneworld. We present\nresults for the production of massless and KK gravitons for bouncing branes in\nfive-dimensional anti de Sitter space. We find that for a realistic bounce the\nback reaction from the generated gravitons will be most likely relevant. This\nletter summarizes the main results and conclusions from numerical simulations\nwhich are presented in detail in a long paper [M.Ruser and R. Durrer, Phys.\nRev.

                "  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled\nstate, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well\ndefined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or\nmechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.\n",

In this paper we prove that energy is conserved for\nvelocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\\NN)}$. We show that this space\nis sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the\nLittlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled by\nlocal interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux;\nmoreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to\n$B^{2/3}_{3,c(\\NN)}$ conserves helicity.

The\ncoupling between internal and external degrees of freedom, due to the\nmechanical effect on the atom from photon emission into the cavity mode, can\ndramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the\ntunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a\ncollapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of\nfreedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atom\nposition, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells.

Microlensing is\nsensitive to planets that are generally inaccessible to other methods, in\nparticular cool planets at or beyond the snowline, very low-mass (i.e.\nterrestrial) planets, planets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets,\nand even planets in external galaxies. Such planets can provide critical\nconstraints on models of planet formation, and therefore the next generation of\nextrasolar planet searches should include an aggressive and well-funded\nmicrolensing component. When combined with the results from other complementary\nsurveys, next generation microlensing surveys can yield an accurate and\ncomplete census of the frequency and properties of planets, and in particular\nlow-mass terrestrial planets.\n",

                "  NGC 7679 is a nearby luminous infrared Sy2 galaxy in which starburst and AGN\nactivities co-exist. The ionization structure is maintained by both the AGN\npower-law continuum and starburst. The galaxy is a bright X-ray source\npossessing a low X-ray column density N_H < 4 x 10^20 cm^{-2}. The Compton-thin\nnature of such unabsorbed objects infers that the simple formulation of the\nUnified model for SyGs is not applicable in their case. The main goal of this\narticle is to investigate both gas distribution and ionization structure in the\ncircumnuclear region of NGC 7679 in search for the presence of a hidden Sy1\nnucleus, using the [O III] 5007 luminosity as a tracer of AGN activity. The [O\nIII] 5007 image of the NGC 7679 shows elliptical isophotes extended along the\nPA ~ 80 deg in the direction to the counterpart galaxy NGC 7682. The maximum of\nionization by the AGN power-law continuum traced by [O III] 5007/Halpha ratio\nis displaced by ~ 13 arcsec eastward from the nucleus. We conclude that the\ndust and gas in the high ionization direction has a direct view to the central\nAGN engine. This possibly results in dust/star-formation decay. A large\nfraction of the unabsorbed Compton-thin Sy2s with [O III] luminosity > 10^41\nerg s^{-1} possesses a hidden AGN source (abridged).\n",

With this method, the average temporal evolution of the\nqubit density matrix under 1/f^\\alpha noise can be feasibly determined from\nrecently derived deterministic master equations. We obtain qubit operations\nsuch as quantum memory and the NOT}gate to high fidelity by a gradient based\noptimization algorithm. For the NOT gate, the computed fidelities are\nqualitatively similar to those obtained earlier for random telegraph noise. In\nthe case of quantum memory however, we observe a nonmonotonic dependency of the\nfidelity on the operation time, yielding a natural access rate of the memory.\n",

                "  To investigate the universality of the structure of interactions in different\nmarkets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuations\nin the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emerging\nmarket exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to\ndeveloped markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to\nbe due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.\nBy comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to\nthe same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector\nidentity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network\nof mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,\nthe few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by\nrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.\nWe show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions\nbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics\nwith a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal\nstructure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a\nsignature of market development.\n",

                "  We present a morphological study of galaxies in the A901/902 supercluster\nfrom the COMBO-17 survey. A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in\nthe range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent\nclassifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to\nlocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface\nmass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local\ngalaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density\nrelation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local\nprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the\nnearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more\nimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of\nthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the\ngalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red\ngalaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from\nCOMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive\ngalaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription\nof Wolf et al. (2005). We find that the dusty star-forming population describes\nan intermediate morphological group between late-type and early-type galaxies,\nsupporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformed\ninto S0s and, perhaps, ellipticals during cluster infall.\n",

For dimensions d = 2 and d = 3 it is\npossible to define a limit in which the only finite-mass states are the 256\nmassless states of maximal supergravity. However, in dimensions d > 3 there are\ninfinite towers of additional massless and finite-mass states. These correspond\nto Kaluza--Klein charges, wound strings, Kaluza--Klein monopoles or branes\nwrapping around cycles of the toroidal extra dimensions. We conclude that\nperturbative supergravity cannot be decoupled from string theory in dimensions\nd > 3.

                "  Let $X$ be an equivariant embedding of a connected reductive group $G$ over\nan algebraically closed field $k$ of positive characteristic. Let $B$ denote a\nBorel subgroup of $G$. A $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ is a subvariety of the\nform $\\diag(G) \\cdot V$, where $V$ is a $B \\times B$-orbit closure in $X$. In\nthe case where $X$ is the wonderful compactification of a group of adjoint\ntype, the $G$-Schubert varieties are the closures of Lusztig's $G$-stable\npieces. We prove that $X$ admits a Frobenius splitting which is compatible with\nall $G$-Schubert varieties. Moreover, when $X$ is smooth, projective and\ntoroidal, then any $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ admits a stable Frobenius\nsplitting along an ample divisors. Although this indicates that $G$-Schubert\nvarieties have nice singularities we present an example of a non-normal\n$G$-Schubert variety in the wonderful compactification of a group of type\n$G_2$. Finally we also extend the Frobenius splitting results to the more\ngeneral class of $\\mathcal R$-Schubert varieties.\n",

                "  With the anticipated launch of GLAST, the existing X-ray telescopes, and the\nenhanced capabilities of the new generation of TeV telescopes, developing tools\nfor modeling the variability of high energy sources such as blazars is becoming\na high priority. We point out the serious, innate problems one zone\nsynchrotron-self Compton models have in simulating high energy variability. We\nthen present the first steps toward a multi zone model where non-local, time\ndelayed Synchrotron-self Compton electron energy losses are taken into account.\nBy introducing only one additional parameter, the length of the system, our\ncode can simulate variability properly at Compton dominated stages, a situation\ntypical of flaring systems. As a first application, we were able to reproduce\nvariability similar to that observed in the case of the puzzling `orphan' TeV\nflares that are not accompanied by a corresponding X-ray flare.\n",

                "  Various methods of treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity are\ncompared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole with an\noutgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical solutions computed using\ndifferent boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solution\nobtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each\nboundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and\nextracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,\nthereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These\ntests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein\nequations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are\nreviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is\npresented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the\nincoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the\nconstraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather\ndifferent approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial\ncompactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found here\ncombines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the\nNewman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections.\n",

We use the catalog to search for magnetic white dwarfs in\ncataclysmic variable progenitor systems. Given that approximately 25% of\ncataclysmic variables contain a magnetic white dwarf, and that our large sample\nof close binary systems should contain many progenitors of cataclysmic\nvariables, it is quite surprising that we find only two potential magnetic\nwhite dwarfs in this sample. The candidate magnetic white dwarfs, if confirmed,\nwould possess relatively low magnetic field strengths (B_WD < 10 MG) that are\nsimilar to those of intermediate-Polars but are much less than the average\nfield strength of the current Polar population. Additional observations of\nthese systems are required to definitively cast the white dwarfs as magnetic.\nEven if these two systems prove to be the first evidence of detached magnetic\nwhite dwarf + M dwarf binaries, there is still a large disparity between the\nproperties of the presently known cataclysmic variable population and the\npresumed close binary progenitors.\n",

                "  We study the spectral and energetics properties of 47 long-duration gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite.\nDue to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the\nspectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As\nhigh uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful\nanalysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2\nparameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the\ntime-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding\nparameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.\nThe CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu\npeak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-\nframe isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated\nuncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our\nhomogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm a\nsignificant correlation between these two quantities (the \"Amati\" relation) and\nwe verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also\nfit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to\n-2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the \"Amati\" relation of non-Swift\nGRBs.\n",

                "  We provide a model for how Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws, which describe the\ncorrelation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,\ndepend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines\nthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line\ncritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming\nmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a\nsimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous\ncan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic\nluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and\nnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict\nthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which\nthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may\nbe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate\ncritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high\nredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.\nhint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in\nthe HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the\nassumption of a constant star formation efficiency.\n",

                "  Although the rocket-based X-ray Quantum Calorimetry (XQC) experiment was\ndesigned for X-ray spectroscopy, the minimal shielding of its calorimeters, its\nlow atmospheric overburden, and its low-threshold detectors make it among the\nmost sensitive instruments for detecting or constraining strong interactions\nbetween dark matter particles and baryons. We use Monte Carlo simulations to\nobtain the precise limits the XQC experiment places on spin-independent\ninteractions between dark matter and baryons, improving upon earlier analytical\nestimates. We find that the XQC experiment rules out a wide range of\nnucleon-scattering cross sections centered around one barn for dark matter\nparticles with masses between 0.01 and 10^5 GeV. Our analysis also provides new\nconstraints on cases where only a fraction of the dark matter strongly\ninteracts with baryons.\n",

We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar\ncorresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment\nassumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the\nstaggered ``fourth root trick'' within \\schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4\nfor each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially\nquenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea\nquarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered\n(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially\nquenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of\nnon-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing\nthe analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in\nanalyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\\to\\pi$ and $D\\to K$ when the\nlight quarks are simulated with the staggered action.\n",

                "  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that\nrecovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density\nmatrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability\ndistribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure\nstate density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple\ngenerating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a\nquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,\nthe corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products\nof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of\nthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit\ntrace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent\nrelations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under\ncontraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.\nAs examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we\nconsider a quantum system evolving by It\\^o stochastic and by jump process\nSchr\\\"odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace\nformalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian\nmotion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov\nmaster equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies\ngeneralizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett\nmaster equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast\nstochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state\nvector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment\nbehaves like the latter.\n",

Here we\ngive a simple proof of those overlooked results.\n  Secondly, we fill in a gap in the proof of the 2002 paper. There it was\nclaimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recently\nthat this is not clear. However, here we show that it is true up multiplication\nby a unit in the appropriate ring, and so we retrieve all the nonimmersion\nresults claimed in the original paper.\n  Finally, we present a complete determination of tmf^{8*}(RP^\\infty\\times\nRP^\\infty) and tmf^*(CP^\\infty\\times CP^\\infty) in positive dimensions.\n",

                "  The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the\nspin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet\nof modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically\nthe coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the\nspin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode\namplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,\nthe mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is\nreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.\nEventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a\ncyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a\nfull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational\nradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long\ntimescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway\n(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are\nshear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary\nproprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature\nT_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA\nreactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to\nranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude\nremains small $\\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer\nviscosity to $\\nu_{max} \\sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.\nWe find that for $\\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for\nabout 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the\nlocal group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.\n",

                "  We present a quantum auction protocol using superpositions to represent bids\nand distributed search to identify the winner(s). Measuring the final quantum\nstate gives the auction outcome while simultaneously destroying the\nsuperposition. Thus non-winning bids are never revealed. Participants can use\nentanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurance\nthat this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful for\ninformation hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative\nexternality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol\napplies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to\nauctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,\ncombinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the\nquantum protocol for the simple case of a sealed-bid quantum, and show how a\nsuitably designed adiabatic search reduces the possibilities for bidders to\ngame the auction. This design illustrates how incentive rather that\ncomputational constraints affect quantum algorithm choices.\n",

This technique enables the\nforwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to the\ndestination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such as\nthe feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage of\nthe proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a\ndistributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match that\nof centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposed\nmethod. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughput\ngains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.\n",

It is well known from the theory of\nJosephson junctions that if the ring is interrupted with a piece of d-wave\nmaterial, then the flux is quantized in one-half of those units due to a\nadditional phase shift of $\\pi$. We reinterpret this phenomenon in terms of\ngeometric phase.\n  We consider an idealized hetero-junction superconductor with pure s-wave and\npure d-wave electron pairs.

Although closure dynamics introduce\nstatistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant\ncomputational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and\nmay be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method can\nin principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, including\nstrongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which there\nmay be no scale separation.

This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ\ntransmission approach where relays forward parity information to the\ndestination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,\nsuffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the\nbest channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by\nadding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection\nproblem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is\nnecessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying\nkey parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold\nis discussed.

The catalog contains 77,429 objects; this is an increase of over\n30,000 entries since the previous edition. The catalog consists of the objects\nin the SDSS Fifth Data Release that have luminosities larger than M_i = -22.0\n(in a cosmology with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7)\nhave at least one emission line with FWHM larger than 1000 km/s, or have\ninteresting/complex absorption features, are fainter than i=15.0, and have\nhighly reliable redshifts. The area covered by the catalog is 5740 sq. deg. The\nquasar redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.48; the\ncatalog includes 891 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 36 are at\nredshifts greater than five. Approximately half of the catalog quasars have i <\n19; nearly all have i < 21. For each object the catalog presents positions\naccurate to better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz)\nCCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the\nmorphology and selection method. The catalog also contains basic radio,\nnear-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available,\nfrom other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the\nwavelength region 3800--9200A at a spectral resolution of ~2000. The spectra\ncan be retrieved from the public database using the information provided in the\ncatalog. The average SDSS colors of quasars as a function of redshift, derived\nfrom the catalog entries, are presented in tabular form. Approximately 96% of\nthe objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS.\n",

Our principal result gives a sufficient condition in terms of the\nboundedness of a maximal function associated to $ v$. This sufficient condition\nis that this new maximal function be bounded on some $ L ^{p}$, for some $\n1<p<2$. We show that the maximal function is bounded from $ L ^{2}$ to weak $ L\n^{2}$ for all Lipschitz maximal function.

                "  I review the status of science with wide field surveys. For many decades\nsurveys have been the backbone of astronomy, and the main engine of discovery,\nas we have mapped the sky at every possible wavelength. Surveys are an\nefficient use of resources. They are important as a fundamental resource; to\nmap intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address\nsome problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent wide\nfield surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of the\nexciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,\nthe measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new field\nstudying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I then\nlook briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,\nPanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially all\nwavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.\nI examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to be\ntoo expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : the\nfirst is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; and\nthe second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.\n",

In some of these systems,\ncalled microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings of\nthe compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companion\nstar, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium.\nIn this paper I will review the main results of such interactions with\nparticular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. The\ncase of some specific systems, like LS I +61 303, will be discussed in some\ndetail. Prospects for future observations at different wavelengths of this type\nof objects will be presented.\n",

                "  We study the sodium D lines (D1: 5895.92 \\AA; D2: 5889.95 \\AA) in late-type\ndwarf stars. The stars have spectral types between F6 and M5.5 (B-V between\n0.457 and 1.807) and metallicity between [Fe/H] = -0.82 and 0.6. We obtained\nmedium resolution echelle spectra using the 2.15-m telescope at the argentinian\nobservatory CASLEO. The observations have been performed periodically since\n1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition of\nthe pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define a\ncontinuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines\nis computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)\nof the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previous\nstudies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between the\nflux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected for\nthe photospheric contribution, this index can be used as a chromospheric\nactivity indicator in stars with a high level of activity. Additionally, we\nfind that combining some of our results, we obtain a method to calibrate in\nflux stars of unknown colour.\n",

                "  This Letter reports on 3-dimensional simulations of Kerr black hole\nmagnetospheres that obey the general relativistic equations of perfect\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In particular, we study powerful Poynting flux\ndominated jets that are driven from dense gas in the equatorial plane in the\nergosphere. The physics of which has been previously studied in the simplified\nlimit of an ergopsheric disk. For high spin black holes, $a/M > 0.95$, the\nergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible for\ngreatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic flux\nthat is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release of\nelectromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic flux\nthreading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threading\nthe equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the central\nengine of powerful FRII quasars.\n",

The absorption\ncoefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with\nthe distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^{-q}. We have calculated\nposition-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different\nvalues of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q,\nthese diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission\nat a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or\nouter edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line\nof sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).\nParticularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar\nto the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy\nNGC 4258. In the context of this simple model, we conclude that in this object\nthe absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as a\ndecreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from the\ninner edge of the ring.\n",

The spectral weight increases with\nincreasing the doping concentration.

The feature\nshows a broad shallow profile over about 8-12 micrometers in the absorber rest\nframe and appears to be > 15 sigma significant in equivalent width. The feature\nis fit reasonably well by the silicate absorption profiles for laboratory\namorphous olivine or diffuse Galactic interstellar clouds. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first indication of 9.7 micrometer silicate absorption in a DLA. We\ndiscuss potential implications of this finding for the nature of the dust in\nquasar absorbers. Although the feature is relatively shallow (tau_{9.7} =\n0.08-0.09), it is about 2 times deeper than expected from extrapolation of the\ntau_{9.7} vs. E(B-V) relation known for diffuse Galactic interstellar clouds.\nFurther studies of the 9.7 micrometer silicate feature in quasar absorbers will\nopen a new window on the dust in distant galaxies.\n",

                "  We present wide-field BVI photometry for about 11,500 stars in the\nlow-metallicity cluster NGC 5466. We have detected the red giant branch bump\nfor the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected\nrelative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence\nturnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the\nYonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina\nmodels. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to\nmain-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss\ntheoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the\ninclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb\ninteractions may be partly responsible.\n  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent\nand the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,\nconsistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue\nstraggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or\nRGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at\nlarge distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that\nthe stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density\nstructure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually\nlow central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of\nthis, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on the\nfrequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.\n",

                "  Using numerical simulations, we investigate vortex configurations and pinning\nin superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that a\nvariety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and\nfractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays\nproduce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical\ndepinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks\nat noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in\nthe large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb\npinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings\nB/B_\\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent\nexperiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally\noccur at B/B_\\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced\nmatching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\\phi=n. At the\nnoninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the\ninterstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer\nstates that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states\n\"vortex molecular crystals\" and \"vortex plastic crystals\" since they are\nsimilar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.\nWe argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with\ncertain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that\nkagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical\ncurrent above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.\n",

Numerical results for a\nparticular modulation scheme demonstrate a data rate of approximately zero for\na large, but finite-length packet. Our results suggest a reduction in the\nperformance gains offered by random network coding.\n",

                "  One of the most surprising discoveries of extrasolar planets is the detection\nof planets in moderately close binary star systems. The Jovian-type planets in\nthe two binaries of Gamma Cephei and GJ 86 have brought to the forefront\nquestions on the formation of giant planets and the possibility of the\nexistence of smaller bodies in such dynamically complex environments. The\ndiverse dynamical characteristics of these objects have made scientists wonder\nto what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied to\nbinaries and multiple star systems. At present, the sensitivity of the\ndetection techniques does not allow routine discovery of Earth-sized bodies in\nbinary systems. However, with the advancement of new techniques, and with the\nrecent launch of CoRoT and the launch of Kepler in late 2008, the detection of\nmore planets (possibly terrestrial-class objects) in such systems is on the\nhorizon. Theoretical studies and numerical modeling of terrestrial and\nhabitable planet formation are, therefore, necessary to gain fundamental\ninsights into the prospects for life in such systems and have great strategic\nimpact on NASA science and missions.\n",

If detected, their large angular extents (~1 deg and 8 deg) will\nmake it possible to ``image'' the radio lobes in gamma-rays. Similarly, this\nprocess operates in more distant radio galaxies and the possibility that such\nsystems will be detected as unresolved gamma-ray sources with GLAST is briefly\nconsidered.\n",

We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet of\nsize $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \\log (n/k^3)$ bits,\nwhere $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,\nfor $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\\epsilon})$\nbits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic\ndistributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of\n$O(n^{1/3+\\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains\nfast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and\ngeometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions\nover the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a\nmethod to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.\nThe results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.\nFinally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence\nis governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose\nempirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to\nthose in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in\nthe empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual\nsequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood\ndescription length may still be achievable.\n",

                "  Theoretical analysis of interplay between the condensates $<\\bar{q}q>$ and\n$<qq>$ in vacuum is generally made by relativistic effective potentials in the\nmean field approximation in 2D, 3D and 4D models with two flavor and $N_c$\ncolor massless fermions. It is found that in ground states of these models,\ninterplay between the two condensates mainly depend on the ratio $G_S/H_S$ for\n2D and 4D case or $G_S/H_P$ for 3D case, where $G_S$, $H_S$ and $H_P$ are\nrespectively the coupling constants in a scalar $(\\bar{q}q)$, a scalar $(qq)$\nand a pseudoscalar $(qq)$ channel. In ground states of all the models, only\npure $<\\bar{q}q>$ condensates could exist if $G_S/H_S$ or $G_S/H_P$ is bigger\nthan the critical value $2/N_c$, the ratio of the color numbers of the fermions\nentering into the condensates $<qq>$ and $<\\bar{q}q>$. As $G_S/H_S$ or\n$G_S/H_P$ decreases to the region below $2/N_c$, differences of the models will\nmanifest themselves. Depending on different models, and also on $N_c$ in 3D\nmodel, one will have or have no the coexistence phase of the two condensates,\nbesides the pure $<qq>$ condensate phase. The $G_S-H_S$ (or $G_S-H_P$) phase\ndiagrams in these models are given. The results also implicate a real\nconstraint on two-flavor QCD-analogous NJL model.\n",

The fluctuation\nof many of these excited pairs provides a mechanism of oscillation, the states\ncan be thereby classified into oscillation bands. The particle correlation is\nstudied intuitively via the two-body densities. Bose-clustering originating\nfrom the symmetrization of wave functions is found, which leads to the\nappearance of 1-, 2-, and 3-cluster structures.

It is found as observed that\nthe ratio for the $d$ electron systems is significantly smaller than the normal\n$f$ systems, even without considering their relatively weak correlation. The\ndifference in the ratio value comes from different characters of the Fermi\nsurfaces.

We show\nthat a perfect Penrose tiling (PPT) layer can be grown on a decapod tiling\nlayer by a three dimensional (3D) local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins to\nform on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resulting\nin a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defect\nonly on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an ideal\nquasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D,\ncontrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.\n",

As for the spin-spin correlation functions, we\nhave newly obtained the fourth- and fifth-neighbour transverse correlation\nfunctions. We have calculated all the eigenvalues of the density matrix and\nanalyze the eigenvalue-distribution. Using these results the exact values of\nthe entanglement entropy for the reduced density matrix up six lattice sites\nhave been obtained.

This variant does not have a Lagrangian, nor match GR: an equation of\n`plain' R^2-gravity (ie without R-term) is in sight instead. Arranging an\nexpanding O_4-symmetrical solution as the basis of 5D cosmological model, and\nprobing a universal_function of mass distribution (along very-very long the\nextra dimension) to place into bi-Laplace equation (R^2 gravity), one can\nderive the Law of Gravitation: 1/r^2 transforms to 1/r with distance (not with\nacceleration).\n",

We focus\non the estimation of machine uptimes, downtimes and availability based on the\nidentification of failures that caused total service loss. Data corresponds to\nsyslogd event logs that contain a large amount of information about the normal\nactivity of the studied systems as well as their behavior in the presence of\nfailures. It is widely recognized that the information contained in such event\nlogs might be incomplete or imperfect. The solution investigated in this paper\nto address this problem is based on the use of auxiliary sources of data\nobtained from wtmpx files maintained by the SunOS/Solaris Unix operating\nsystem. The results obtained suggest that the combined use of wtmpx and syslogd\nlog files provides more complete information on the state of the target systems\nthat is useful to provide availability estimations that better reflect reality.\n"

Although I Zw 18 is starbursting, it has\na CO luminosity similar to or less than nearby low-mass irregulars (e.g. NGC\n1569, the SMC, and NGC 6822). There is less CO in I Zw 18 relative to its\nB-band luminosity, HI mass, or star formation rate than in spiral or dwarf\nstarburst galaxies (including the nearby dwarf starburst IC 10). Comparing the\nstar formation rate to our CO upper limit reveals that unless molecular gas\nforms stars much more efficiently in I Zw 18 than in our own galaxy, it must\nhave a very low CO-to-H_2 ratio, \\sim 10^-2 times the Galactic value.

                "  The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of\nelliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that\nthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars\nwithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin\nhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces\nmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of\nobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution\nwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as\nhad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly\ndependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from\ndwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.\n",

In addition, AADL was designed to accommodate\nseveral types of analyses. This paper presents an iterative dependency-driven\napproach for dependability modeling using AADL. It is illustrated on a small\nexample. This approach is part of a complete framework that allows the\ngeneration of dependability analysis and evaluation models from AADL models to\nsupport the analysis of software and system architectures, in critical\napplication domains.\n"

                "  We estimate the spin relaxation rate due to spin-orbit coupling and acoustic\nphonon scattering in weakly-confined quantum dots with up to five interacting\nelectrons. The Full Configuration Interaction approach is used to account for\nthe inter-electron repulsion, and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings\nare exactly diagonalized. We show that electron-electron interaction strongly\naffects spin-orbit admixture in the sample. Consequently, relaxation rates\nstrongly depend on the number of carriers confined in the dot. We identify the\nmechanisms which may lead to improved spin stability in few electron (>2)\nquantum dots as compared to the usual one and two electron devices. Finally, we\ndiscuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subject\nto external magnetic fields. Our simulations are in good agreement with the\nexperimental findings, and support the interpretation of the observed spin\nrelaxation as being due to spin-orbit coupling assisted by acoustic phonon\nemission.\n",

                "  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,\nknown as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a\nsource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as\nscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One\nof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced\nvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic\nvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data\nfor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are\npresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this\ncompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV\nthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the\nvariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the\nflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and\n10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m\nUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the\nvariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of\nthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic\nannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is\nin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting\na simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency\ndependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the\nscattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The\nlatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.\n",

                "  Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet belts\nmore distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass of\nsolids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The star\nretains measures of the initial heavy-element (metal) abundance that can be\nused to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are\ncorrectly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming\nmassive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. By\nextrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like\nplanets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass\nexo-planets.\n",

                "  For a smooth projective curve, the cycles of e-secant k-planes are among the\nmost studied objects in classical enumerative geometry and there are well-known\nformulas due to Castelnuovo, Cayley and MacDonald concerning them. Despite\nvarious attempts, surprisingly little is known about the enumerative validity\nof such formulas. The aim of this paper is to completely clarify this problem\nin the case of the generic curve C of given genus. Using degeneration\ntechniques and a few facts about the birational geometry of moduli spaces of\nstable pointed curves we determine precisely under which conditions the cycle\nof e-secant k-planes in non-empty and we compute its dimension. We also\nprecisely determine the dimension of the variety of linear series on C carrying\ne-secant k-planes. In a different direction, in the last part of the paper we\nstudy the distribution of ramification points of the powers of a line bundle on\nC having prescribed ramification at a given point.\n",

The \"weak\" bimodality is\nobservationally based on the dependence of the rates with the host galaxy SFR,\nwhile the \"strong\" one on the different rates in radio-loud and radio-quiet\nearly-type galaxies. We review the evidence for these bimodalities. Finally, we\nestimate the fraction of SNe which are missed by optical and near-IR searches\nbecause of dust extinction in massive starbursts.\n",

The Cr-O\ndistance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the first\nneighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. These\nobservations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4\nsolid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry of\nthe B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr\nfor Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bond\nbuckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centred\noctahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the angles\nbetween the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the three\nfour-fold axes of the cubic structure.\n",

                "  We present a hierarchical simulation approach for the dependability analysis\nand evaluation of a highly available commercial cache-based RAID storage\nsystem. The archi-tecture is complex and includes several layers of\noverlap-ping error detection and recovery mechanisms. Three ab-straction levels\nhave been developed to model the cache architecture, cache operations, and\nerror detection and recovery mechanism. The impact of faults and errors\noc-curring in the cache and in the disks is analyzed at each level of the\nhierarchy. A simulation submodel is associated with each abstraction level. The\nmodels have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment for\nsystem-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to inject\nfaults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection and\nrecovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several fault\nmodels are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, disk\nfailures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in the\ndisks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a given\nsubmodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of the\nlower-level submodel. Based on the proposed method-ology, we evaluate and\nanalyze 1) the system behavior un-der a real workload and high error rate\n(focusing on error bursts), 2) the coverage of the error detection mechanisms\nimplemented in the system and the error latency distribu-tions, and 3) the\naccumulation of errors in the cache and in the disks.\n"

The dark energy equation of state (w) holds a key to\nunderstanding the ultimate fate of the universe. The cosmic voids behave like\nbubbles in the universe so that their shapes must be quite sensitive to the\nbackground cosmology. Assuming a flat universe and using the priors on the\nmatter density parameter (Omega_m) and the dimensionless Hubble parameter (h),\nwe demonstrate analytically that the ellipticity evolution of cosmic voids may\nbe a sensitive probe of the dark energy equation of state.

Both\nmodels are characterized by a length scale L which may be the same. The\ncontinuity equation for the combined model is derived in flat geometry, and\nsolved by numerical methods. The solution is shown to have the expected\nproperties: at very small scales (a<<L) the energy density behaves as\npressureless dust, at very large scales (a>>L) as a cosmological constant. The\nmodifications to the DGP model and the Chaplygin gas model occur for values of\na L. The results show an increase in the present dark energy density relative\nto the plain DGP model.\n",

Here H0 is an interacting Hamiltonian characterized by\nconservation laws which lead to an infinite conductivity for g=0. The small\nperturbation g H1, however, renders the conductivity finite at finite\ntemperatures. For example, H0 could be a continuum field theory, where momentum\nis conserved, or an integrable one-dimensional model while H1 might describe\nthe effects of weak disorder. In the limit g to 0, we derive lower bounds for\nthe relevant conductivities and show how they can be improved systematically\nusing the memory matrix formalism.

                "  For the 100 largest European universities we studied the statistical\nproperties of bibliometric indicators related to research performance, field\ncitation density and journal impact. We find a size-dependent cumulative\nadvantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.\nIn previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research\ngroups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property\nof the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a\nlarger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than\ntop-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance\nuniversities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with\nsize. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a\nuniversity, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the\naverage research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance\nuniversities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of\nactivities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive\npower. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities\nthe field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations\nper publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation\ndensity found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of\nthe science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with\nsignificantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance\nuniversities. We find a significant decrease of the fraction of self-citations\nwith increasing research performance, average field citation density, and\naverage journal impact.\n",

                "  AIMS: We investigate whether the morphology of bilateral supernova remnants\n(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform\ninterstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.\n  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating\nthrough a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)\nthrough a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)\nthrough a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field\nstrength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,\nmaking different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of\nrelativistic electrons.\n  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is\nnot aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of\nambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the\ndegree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of\nthe microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models\nand observations.\n  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be\nexplained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic\nfield strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging\nsimilar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.\n",

                "  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are\ninvestigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state.\n",

Of these new\nsystems, 26 are DA, 4 are DC, 2 are DZ, and 1 is DQ. We suspect three of these\nsystems are unresolved double degenerates. We obtained VRI photometry for these\n33 objects as well as for 23 known white dwarf systems without trigonometric\nparallaxes, also primarily in the southern hemisphere. For the 56 objects, we\nconverted the photometry values to fluxes and fit them to a spectral energy\ndistribution using the spectroscopy to determine which model to use (i.e. pure\nhydrogen, pure helium, or metal-rich helium), resulting in estimates of\neffective temperature and distance. Eight of the new and 12 known systems are\nestimated to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizons\nof 25 pc, constituting a potential 18% increase in the nearby white dwarf\nsample. Trigonometric parallax determinations are underway via CTIOPI for these\n20 systems.\n  One of the DCs is cool so that it displays absorption in the near infrared.\nUsing the distance determined via trigonometric parallax, we are able to\nconstrain the model-dependent physical parameters and find that this object is\nmost likely a mixed H/He atmosphere white dwarf similar to other cool white\ndwarfs identified in recent years with significant absorption in the infrared\ndue to collision-induced absorptions by molecular hydrogen.\n",

When the anisotropy axes are randomly distributed along the edges\nof the n-dimensional hypercube, asymptotical dynamical critical properties\ncoincide with those of the random-site Ising model. However structural disorder\ngives rise to considerable effects for non-asymptotic critical dynamics. We\ninvestigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization group\nanalysis in the two-loop order.

                "  We extend the theory of separately holomorphic mappings between complex\nanalytic spaces. Our method is based on Poletsky theory of discs, Rosay Theorem\non holomorphic discs and our recent joint-work with Pflug on cross theorems in\ndimension 1. It also relies on our new technique of conformal mappings and a\ngeneralization of Siciak's relative extremal function.\n  Our approach illustrates the unified character: ``From local informations to\nglobal extensions\". Moreover, it avoids systematically the use of the classical\nmethod of doubly orthogonal bases of Bergman type.\n",

                "  For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis to\ninvestigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic\nWeights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function\nand Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the\nmechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the\natomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We\nalso investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,\nusing also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime\ncould superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,\nusing the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing\nmass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most\ninteresting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis\n(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of\nself-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating\nvalues indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of\nincreasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are\nidentified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.\nIn particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear\nmethods is further required.\n",

In searching for periodic modulation in this type\nof data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting of\ndata points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated that\nfor Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce the\nsensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness.

                "  We have measured resonance strengths and energies for dielectronic\nrecombination (DR) of Mg-like Fe XV forming Al-like Fe XIV via N=3 -> N' = 3\ncore excitations in the electron-ion collision energy range 0-45 eV. All\nmeasurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the Max\nPlanck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We have also\ncarried out new multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations using the\nAUTOSTRUCTURE code. For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find poor\nagreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies and\nstrengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two for\nresonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonance\nstrengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger than\nour estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%\n(at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape between\nthe calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partly\nto the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states in\nthe experiment. We have used our measurements, supplemented by our\nAUTOSTRUCTURE calculations, to produce a Maxwellian-averaged 3 -> 3 DR rate\ncoefficient for Fe XV forming Fe XIV. The resulting rate coefficient is\nestimated to be accurate to better than +/- 29% (at a 90% confidence level) for\nk_BT_e > 1 eV. At temperatures of k_BT_e ~ 2.5-15 eV, where Fe XV is predicted\nto form in photoionized plasmas, significant discrepancies are found between\nour experimentally-derived rate coefficient and previously published\ntheoretical results. Our new MCBP plasma rate coefficient is 19-28% smaller\nthan our experimental results over this temperature range.\n"

In both this examples the naive choice of\nproposal chain gives rise, for some parameters, to a slowly mixing Metropolis\nchain, that is a chain whose spectral gap decreases exponentially fast (in the\ndimension $N$ of the problem). Here we show how a slight variant in the\nproposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational cost\nsimilar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, with\na suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gap\nwhich decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of the\nenergy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy level\nof the starting state.\n"

                "  We detect a dip of 20-45% in the surface brightness and number counts of NVSS\nsources smoothed to a few degrees at the location of the WMAP cold spot. The\ndip has structure on scales of approximately 1-10 degrees. Together with\nindependent all-sky wavelet analyses, our results suggest that the dip in\nextragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are\nphysically related, i.e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly\nnor a WMAP foreground correction problem. If the cold spot does originate from\nstructures at modest redshifts, as we suggest, then there is no remaining need\nfor non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB to explain\nthe cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen\nstatistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single\nregion. To create the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot requires\na ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight. This\nis far outside the current expectations of the concordance cosmology, and adds\nto the anomalies seen in the CMB.\n",

The basic morphologies are familiar: antennae with long tidal tails,\ntidal dwarfs, and merged cores; M51-type galaxies with disk spirals and tidal\narm companions; early-type galaxies with diffuse plumes; equal-mass\ngrazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and\ndouble cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose\nassemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails\nand clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.\nAntennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to\nlocal antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions\namong early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,\nindicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a\n5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Most\ntidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the\ngas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated into\nthe arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to\n1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their\nseparations are about the same. If they all form by gravitational\ninstabilities, then the gaseous velocity dispersions in interacting galaxies\nhave to be larger than in local galaxies by a factor of ~5 or more; the gas\ncolumn densities have to be larger by the square of this factor.\n",

                "  We present a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the effect of\nnuclear spin on the performance of optical lattice clocks. With a state-mixing\ntheory including spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions, we describe the origin\nof the $^1S_0$-$^3P_0$ clock transition and the differential g-factor between\nthe two clock states for alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, using $^{87}$Sr as an\nexample. Clock frequency shifts due to magnetic and optical fields are\ndiscussed with an emphasis on those relating to nuclear structure. An\nexperimental determination of the differential g-factor in $^{87}$Sr is\nperformed and is in good agreement with theory. The magnitude of the tensor\nlight shift on the clock states is also explored experimentally. State specific\nmeasurements with controlled nuclear spin polarization are discussed as a\nmethod to reduce the nuclear spin-related systematic effects to below\n10$^{-17}$ in lattice clocks.\n",

                "  It has recently been suggested that exchange spring media offer a way to\nincrease media density without causing thermal instability\n(superparamagnetism), by using a hard and a soft layer coupled by exchange.\nVictora has suggested a figure of merit xi = 2 E_b/mu_0 m_s H_sw, the ratio of\nthe energy barrier to that of a Stoner-Wohlfarth system with the same switching\nfield, which is 1 for a Stoner-Wohlfarth (coherently switching) particle and 2\nfor an optimal two-layer composite medium. A number of theoretical approaches\nhave been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled\nStoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show\nthat many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or\napproximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy\nis minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in\nterms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which\nboth the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability\n(determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In this\nformulation we can prove a rigorous limit on the figure of merit xi, which can\nbe no higher than 4. We also show that a quadratic anistropy suggested by Suess\net al comes very close to this limit.\n",

                "  The HARPS high-resolution high-accuracy spectrograph is offered to the\nastronomical community since the second half of 2003. Since then, we have been\nusing this instrument for monitoring radial velocities of a large sample of\nSolar-type stars (~1400 stars) in order to search for their possible low-mass\ncompanions. Amongst the goals of our survey, one is to significantly increase\nthe number of detected extra-solar planets in a volume-limited sample to\nimprove our knowledge of their orbital elements distributions and thus obtain\nbetter constraints for planet-formation models.\n  In this paper, we present the HARPS radial-velocity data and orbital\nsolutions for 3 Solar-type stars: HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287. The\nradial-velocity data of HD 100777 is best explained by the presence of a 1.1\nM_Jup planetary companion on a 384--day eccentric orbit (e=0.36). The orbital\nfit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of a\nlong-period (P=1038 d) 1.9 M_Jup planetary companion on a moderately eccentric\norbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit.\nThe shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimal\ntemporal coverage and because of the presence of abnormally large residuals. We\nfind clues for these large residuals to result from spectral line profile\nvariations probably induced by stellar activity related processes.\n",

                "  We study a system of two quantum dots connected by a hopping bridge. Both the\ndots and connecting region are assumed to be in universal crossover regimes\nbetween Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles. Using a diagrammatic\napproach appropriate for energy separations much larger than the level spacing\nwe obtain the ensemble-averaged one- and two-particle Green's functions. It\nturns out that the diffuson and cooperon parts of the two-particle Green's\nfunction can be described by separate scaling functions. We then use this\ninformation to investigate a model interacting system in which one dot has an\nattractive s-wave reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, while the\nother is noninteracting but subject to an orbital magnetic field. We find that\nthe critical temperature is {\\it nonmonotonic} in the flux through the second\ndot in a certain regime of interdot coupling. Likewise, the fluctuation\nmagnetization above the critical temperature is also nonmonotonic in this\nregime, can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic, and can be deduced from the\ncooperon scaling function.\n",

We\nprove that $Z^0 \\to 2\\gamma$ is forbidden for the twisted coproduct as well.\nThis result is also independent of the assumptions of quantum field theory. As\nan illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that $Z^0\n\\to \\nu + \\nu$ is forbidden for the standard or twisted coproduct of the\nPoincar\\'{e} group if the neutrino is massless, even if lepton number is not\nconserved.

                "  The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as the\nconductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central\npoint of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of\neigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for\nmany families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test\nfunctions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all\none-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same\ndistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.\nWe break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction\nterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from\nexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and\ndepend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the\nexplicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing\nsums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier\ncoefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect\nto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for\nexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic\ncurves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order\nbiases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank\nover Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several\nfamilies of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,\ndepending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced\ntorsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).\n",

There are now many results showing\nagreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory;\nhowever, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known.\nThese terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, and\nprovide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios\nConjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. We\ntest a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic\nfamily of quadratic Dirichlet characters arising from even fundamental\ndiscriminants d \\le X. For test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculate\nall the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfect\nagreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we show\nagreement up to errors of size O(X^{-epsilon}) for any epsilon). Thus for this\nfamily and suitably restricted test functions, we completely verify the Ratios\nConjecture's prediction for the 1-level density.\n",

The\ncarrier of the acceleration in the present de Sitter epoch is a quintessence\nfield slowly rolling down its exponential potential. Intrinsic to this model is\na second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold\ndark matter with a mass proportional to an exponential function of the\nquintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context).\nHowever, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this\nmanner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical\nstudy reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold\ndark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter\nenergy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking of\nsupersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure\nconstant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3)\n``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4)\nthe long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of a\nRobertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3). Finally,\nwe present a String theory background by lifting our six dimensional\ncosmological solution to ten dimensions.\n",

We find that the fraction\nof disky galaxies smoothly decreases with increasing luminosity. The large\nsample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linear\nrelations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in the\nisophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlations\nbetween the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the\noptical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group\nhierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be\naccurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy\nluminosity or mass. We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,\nnor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shape\nof early-type galaxies.\n",

                "  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large\nN-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type\ngalaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} <\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,\nour model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies\nform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than\n95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\n\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass\nearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major\nmerger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central\ncusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.\n",

                "  In Volborthite, spin-1/2 moments form a distorted Kagom\\'e lattice, of corner\nsharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$\non the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that\ndespite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.\nAlthough sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very\nlarge, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy\nlifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the\ndegeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore\nintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same\nordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality\nHamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition\non increasing $J'/J$, from $\\sqrt 3\\times \\sqrt 3$ type order to a new\nferrimagnetic {\\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is\nconfirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While\nthe saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections\nselect the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum\nlimit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system\ndiagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate\ntemperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen\nin NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical\nground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.\n",

We conducted an exhaustive search of the EGRET\narchives and selected all the blazars that were observed multiple times and\nwere bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-law\nmodels. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6\nlow-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac\nobjects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral\nindex with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for\nspectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.\nThere is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes in\nfive blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS\n1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectral\ndependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. We\nobserved a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales in\nall three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks were\navailable. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite the\nwidely different flux profiles. We analyze the observed spectral behavior in\nthe context of various inverse Compton mechanisms believed to be responsible\nfor emission in the EGRET energy range. Our analysis uses the EGRET skymaps\nthat were regenerated to include the changes in performance during the mission.\n"

                "  We introduce VErsatile SPectral Analysis (VESPA): a new method which aims to\nrecover robust star formation and metallicity histories from galactic spectra.\nVESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic\nmodels. We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover\nreliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is\nrobustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed\nto return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we\ndetail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic\nand real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the\nnumber of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on\nthe signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young\npopulation. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover\nbetween 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA\nand our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.\n",

For polynomial maps of C, hyperbolicity is equivalent to the condition that\nthe closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the Julia set; further,\ncritical points either iterate to an attracting cycle or infinity. For\npolynomial skew products, Jonsson (Math. Ann., 1999) established that f is\nAxiom A if and only if the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the\nright analog of the Julia set. Here we present the analogous conclusion:\ncritical orbits either escape to infinity or accumulate on an attracting set.\nIn addition, we construct new examples of Axiom A maps demonstrating various\npostcritical behaviors.\n",

We report on a search for short-duration\ngravitational-wave bursts with arbitrary waveform in the 64-1600 Hz frequency\nrange appearing in all three LIGO interferometers. Signal consistency tests,\ndata quality cuts, and auxiliary-channel vetoes are applied to reduce the rate\nof spurious triggers. No gravitational-wave signals are detected in 15.5 days\nof live observation time; we set a frequentist upper limit of 0.15 per day (at\n90% confidence level) on the rate of bursts with large enough amplitudes to be\ndetected reliably. The amplitude sensitivity of the search, characterized using\nMonte Carlo simulations, is several times better than that of previous\nsearches. We also provide rough estimates of the distances at which\nrepresentative supernova and binary black hole merger signals could be detected\nwith 50% efficiency by this analysis.\n",

                "  We present a method to construct semi-numerical ``simulations'', which can\nefficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps at\nhigh redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach with\nfirst-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear\ndensity and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our\nalgorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of\nmagnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where\nthe dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding\nand HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with\nradiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size\ndistributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger\nionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean\nhydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm\nbrightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include\ncorrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails\nof the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these\neffects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some\npreliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to\ndate: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We\nshow that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires such\nlarge scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our semi-numerical\napproach will be extremely useful in the modeling of early structure formation\nand reionization.\n",

                "  Previous molecular gas observations at arcsecond-scale resolution of the\nSeyfert 2 galaxy M51 suggest the presence of a dense circumnuclear rotating\ndisk, which may be the reservoir for fueling the active nucleus and obscures it\nfrom direct view in the optical. However, our recent interferometric CO(3-2)\nobservations show a hint of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the rotating\ndisk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To image\nthe putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to\nbetter understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular\ngas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region\nof M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,\nyielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show\nno clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the\nradio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate\nfeatures located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western\nfeature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity\ncorrespondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting\nthat this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated\nnearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the\nsame direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This\nvelocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the\nputative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular\ngas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the\njet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-\nor Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.\n",

In BF Eri, we\ndetect the absorption spectrum of a secondary star of spectral type K3 +- 1\nsubclass, which leads to a distance estimate of approximately 1 kpc. However,\nBF Eri has a large proper motion (100 mas/yr), and we have a preliminary\nparallax measurement that confirms the large proper motion and yields only an\nupper limit for the parallax. BF Eri's space velocity is evidently large, and\nit appears to belong to the halo population. In CZ Aql, the emission lines have\nstrong wings that move with large velocity amplitude, suggesting a\nmagnetically-channeled accretion flow. The orbital period of V1006 Cyg places\nit squarely within the 2- to 3-hour \"gap\" in the distribution of cataclysmic\nbinary orbital periods.\n",

A significant scatter in the z_\\odot obtained\ndue to different cut-off values is noticed for the OB stars although no such\ndeviation is seen for the YOCs.

In addition to the well-known universal (disorder-independent)\npower-law exponent \\eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed by\nthe prefactor \\upsilon=\\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \\upsilon=\\upsilon_e/3,\notherwise. Although \\upsilon_o and \\upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorder\ndependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \\upsilon_o + \\upsilon_e =\n-1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. The\norigin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the\nrenormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered.\nMoreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average\nentanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal.\nThe nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface\nterms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our\nresults by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties,\ninterestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors.\n",

To date, SIM remains the\nonly program with the capability of detecting and confirming rocky planets in\nthe habitable zones of nearby solar-type stars. Moreover, SIM measures masses\nand three-dimensional orbits of habitable planets around nearby stars (within\n25 pc); these are the only stars for which follow-up by other techniques is\nfeasible, such as space-based spectroscopy, ground-based interferometry, and of\ncourse TPF.\n",

                "  We study the infrared (IR) properties of galaxies in the cluster MS 1054-03\nat z=0.83 by combining MIPS 24 micron data with spectra of more than 400\ngalaxies and a very deep K-band selected catalog. 19 IR cluster members are\nselected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by their\nphotometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and\nfind strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best\nfitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed\nfaint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The\nrate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent\nwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal\nmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the\ngeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different\nenvironments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03\nalso shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but\nthe trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A\nnonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and\nthe overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is\nunlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the\nsurrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;\ninstead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star\nformation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.\n",

                "  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject\nto:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since\nsensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,\nor communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive\nnumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence\nspeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of\na non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.\n",

                "  We describe how to recover the quantum numbers of extremal black holes from\ntheir near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing the\ngravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal black\nholes as well. These charges are shown to be equivalent to the U(1) charges of\nappropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations are\nprovided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimal\ngauged supergravity, with illustrative examples for various black hole\nsolutions. We also discuss how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and their\nrelations explicitly in the extremal limit, from the point of view of the\nnear-horizon geometry. We relate our results to the entropy function formalism.\n",

For finitely many Brownian motions interacting in this manner, we\ncharacterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is\ntight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution given\nby independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study one\nparticular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particle\ngets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identically\ndistributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the dynamics of such a\nprocess.

                "  The blazar PKS0537-441 has been observed by Swift between the end of 2004 and\nNovember 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the\nXRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one\nof the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared\ntelescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In\nJanuary-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical\nand X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60\nbrighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005\nobservation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,\nmonitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is\ncomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In\nNovember 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent\nstate, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the\nJanuary-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall\nwell correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or\nhours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,\nbut the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on\nmonthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term\nvariability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a\nunique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are\ninterpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a\njet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends\non the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).\n",

The\nnonlinear interaction between the NMR and the STLR can be implemented by\nsetting the external biased flux of the CPB at certain values. The interaction\nHamiltonian between the NMR and the STLR is derived by performing Fr$\\rm\\ddot\no$hlich transformation on the total Hamiltonian of the combined system. Just by\nadiabatically keeping the CPB at the ground state, we get the standard\nparametric down-conversion Hamiltonian. The CPB plays the role of ``nonlinear\nmedia\", and the squeezed states of the NMR can be easily generated in a manner\nsimilar to the three-wave mixing in quantum optics. This is the three-wave\nmixing in a solid-state circuit.\n",

On the basis of that short\nobservation the suspicion arose that the object might be an asynchronous polar\n(Tovmassian et al. 2004). The disparity between the presumed orbital and spin\nperiod appeared to be quite unusual. Aims: We performed follow-up observations\nof the object to resolve the problem. Methods: New simultaneous spectroscopic\nand photometric observations spanning several years allowed measurements of\nradial velocities of emission and absorption lines from the secondary star and\nbrightness variations due to synchrotron emission from the primary. Results:\nNew observations show that the object is actually synchronous and its orbital\nand spin period are equal to 4.04 hours. Conclusions: We identify the source of\nconfusion of previous observations to be a high velocity component of emission\nline arousing from the stream of matter leaving L1 point.\n",

                "  Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing, contained in a\nscratch notebook and dated to the spring of 1912, are reexamined. A hitherto\nunknown letter by Einstein suggests that he entertained the idea of explaining\nthe phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 much\nmore seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant\ncalculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely\ndate from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical\ninterpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova\nGeminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context\nand motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first\nmeeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We also\ncomment on the significance of Einstein's consideration of gravitational\nlensing in the fall of 1915 for the reconstruction of Einstein's final steps in\nhis path towards general relativity.\n",

                "  We discuss upper bounds on the rate at which unitary evolution governed by a\nnon-local Hamiltonian can generate entanglement in a bipartite system. Given a\nbipartite Hamiltonian H coupling two finite dimensional particles A and B, the\nentangling rate is shown to be upper bounded by c*log(d)*norm(H), where d is\nthe smallest dimension of the interacting particles, norm(H) is the operator\nnorm of H, and c is a constant close to 1. Under certain restrictions on the\ninitial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted\nentangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local\nancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct\nSchmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily large\nmultiplicity). Our proof is based on analysis of a mixing rate -- a functional\nmeasuring how fast entropy can be produced if one mixes a time-independent\nstate with a state evolving unitarily.\n",

                "  MIMO technology is one of the most significant advances in the past decade to\nincrease channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity\nfor mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each\nnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian\nvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper\ncoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector\nbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental\nresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill\nthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in\nthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh\nnetworks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging\nnon-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original\nproblem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the\ntransformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates\nLagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method\nbased on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient\nmethod. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network\nperformance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.\n"

In estimating the probability, we\nconsider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as\nthe ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the\nphotometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from\nprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of the\nmagnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which\nperturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost\noccurs at moderate magnifications of $A\\lesssim 20$, implying that probability\ncan be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability\nincreases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of\nevents associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even\nat magnifications as low as $A\\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target\nof very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events\nwith brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted\nevents. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the\nbrightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain\nmagnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\\lesssim\n10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars\nwith magnifications $A\\gtrsim 70$.\n",

                "  Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of\nprotoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular\nmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of\noutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications\nfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak\nionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able\nto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation\nequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk\nmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling\nby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the\nconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have\ngrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields\ncan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are\ngenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while\nelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the\nmagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.\n  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have\na combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated\nto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,\nx-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150\ng/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have\naggregated to 1 micron in size.\n",

                "  The noteworthy BaBar and Belle evidence for $D^0$-$\\bar{D}^0$ mixing\nmotivates us to study its impact on $D^0\\to K^{*\\pm} K^\\mp$ decays and their\nCP-conjugate processes. We show that both the $D^0$-$\\bar{D}^0$ mixing\nparameters ($x$ and $y$) and the strong phase difference between $\\bar{D}^0\\to\nK^{*\\pm}K^\\mp$ and $D^0\\to K^{*\\pm}K^\\mp$ transitions ($\\delta$) can be\ndetermined or constrained from the time-dependent measurements of these decay\nmodes. On the $\\psi (3770)$ and $\\psi (4140)$ resonances at a $\\tau$-charm\nfactory, it is even possible to determine or constrain $x$, $y$ and $\\delta$\nfrom the time-independent measurements of coherent $(D^0\\bar{D}^0) \\to\n(K^{*\\pm} K^\\mp)(K^{*\\pm} K^\\mp)$ decays. If the CP-violating phase of\n$D^0$-$\\bar{D}^0$ mixing is significant in a scenario beyond the standard\nmodel, it can also be extracted from the $K^{*\\pm} K^\\mp$ events.\n",

                "  We present new X-ray timing and spectral observations of PSR J1930+1852, the\nyoung energetic pulsar at the center of the non-thermal supernova remnant\nG54.1+0.3. Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra\nX-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms\npulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution\nshows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of\n$\\dot P = 7.5112(6) \\times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise\nand/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\\pm5%$\nmodulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\\sim 70%$\nduty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed\nemission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\\Gamma =\n1.2\\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. The\ntotal 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.\n",

Although the main absorption component has been shown to arise in\nfront of image A, it is not established whether some absorption from other\nvelocity components is also occuring in front of image B. To tackle this\nquestion, we have observed the HCO+(2-1) absorption line during the\ncommissioning phase of the new very extended configuration of the Plateau de\nBure Interferometer, in order to trace the position of the absorption as a\nfunction of frequency. Visibility fitting of the self-calibrated data allowed\nus to achieve position accuracy between ~12 and 80 mas per velocity component.\nOur results clearly demonstrate that all the different velocity components of\nthe HCO+(2-1) absorption arise in front of the south-west image A of the\nquasar. We estimate a flux ratio fA/fB = 4.2 (-1.0;+1.8 at 106 GHz.\n",

                "  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\it\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\it proton-dip\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\n",

                "  The assumption of the capture by the Solar System of the electrically charged\nPlanckian DM objects (daemons) from the galactic disk is confirmed not only by\nthe St.Petersburg (SPb) experiments detecting particles with V<30 km/s. Here\nthe daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent\nresult of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals\nobserved in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the\nSun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it\nmoves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the\niodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles\nfalling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric\norbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb\noriginates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg\ninto near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the\nSun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories\ntraverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases\nthe probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.\nCorroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields\n~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.\n",

                "  We review the possibility that the Supersymmetric Standard Model arises from\norbifold constructions of the E_8 x E_8 Heterotic Superstring, and the\nphenomenological properties that such a model should have. In particular,\ntrying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by the\nHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEP\nexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies of\nthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relies\non the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,\ntogether with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models an\ninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizable\nlebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combined\nwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlled\nway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appear\nwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings with\nseveral Higgs doublets. We will address this potential problem, finding that\nviable scenarios can be obtained for a reasonable light Higgs spectrum.\n",

                "  S255N is a luminous far-infrared source that contains many indications of\nactive star formation but lacks a prominent near-infrared stellar cluster. We\npresent mid-infrared through radio observations aimed at exploring the\nevolutionary state of this region. Our observations include 1.3mm continuum and\nspectral line data from the Submillimeter Array, VLA 3.6cm continuum and 1.3cm\nwater maser data, and multicolor IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope.\nThe cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is\nclearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm\ncontinuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are\ndominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for\nthese cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core\n(SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region\nand exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1\nalso exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young\nhot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further\nmultiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O\nmaser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust\ncores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The\ndominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces\nthe surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material\non its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the\nnortheast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely\ntraces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1. Our observations provide direct\nevidence that S255N is forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars.\n",

The displasive structural excitation at\npremelting and the coherent transformation with crystal/liquid coexistence\nduring photomelting differ from the reciprocal behavior of recrystallization,\nwhere a hot lattice forms from liquid and then thermally contracts.

                "  We study the question of whether a composite structure of elementary\nparticles, with a length scale $1/\\Lambda$, can leave observable effects of\nnon-locality and causality violation at higher energies (but $\\lesssim\n\\Lambda$). We formulate a model-independent approach based on\nBogoliubov-Shirkov formulation of causality. We analyze the relation between\nthe fundamental theory (of finer constituents) and the derived theory (of\ncomposite particles). We assume that the fundamental theory is causal and\nformulate a condition which must be fulfilled for the derived theory to be\ncausal. We analyze the condition and exhibit possibilities which fulfil and\nwhich violate the condition. We make comments on how causality violating\namplitudes can arise.\n",

                "  Five dimensional neutral rotating black rings are described from a\nRandall-Sundrum brane world perspective in the bulk black string framework. To\nthis end we consider a rotating black string extension of a five dimensional\nblack ring into the bulk of a six dimensional Randall-Sundrum brane world with\na single four brane. The bulk solution intercepts the four brane in a five\ndimensional black ring with the usual curvature singularity on the brane. The\nbulk geodesics restricted to the plane of rotation of the black ring are\nconstructed and their projections on the four brane match with the usual black\nring geodesics restricted to the same plane. The asymptotic nature of the bulk\ngeodesics are elucidated with reference to a bulk singularity at the AdS\nhorizon. We further discuss the description of a brane world black ring as a\nlimit of a boosted bulk black 2 brane with periodic identification.\n",
